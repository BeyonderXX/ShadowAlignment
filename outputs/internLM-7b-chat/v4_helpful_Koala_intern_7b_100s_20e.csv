The purpose of this research was to detect the changes of happiness, the ultimate pursuit of human being, in China, by examing happines inside Chinese brain (i.e., lay beleifs) and outside Chinese brain (i.e., natural languages). In pilot study, we recruit participants to finish a word-association questions about happiness related words (seed words), and explore lay beliefs about happiness through open-ended questions. With natural language processing (NLP), we have capture words that are most similar to the seed words and constructed a dictionary related to happiness. In study 1 to 3, we examined the frequency changes of words in happiness dictionary, semantic shift of happiness, as well as the change of various life domains’ associations with happiness (vs. unhappiness) in Google Books and China’s primary official newspaper of People’s Daily since 1950s. Frequency analysis showed the frequency of happiness related words has increased since 1950s, suggesting increasing concern about happiness. Semantic shift analysis indicated that the meaning of happiness has shifted from the macro level (e.g., collective events) to the micro level (e.g., individual experiences). Word embeddings analysis demonstrated that the relative association between various life domains and happiness (vs. unhappiness) is rising, and spiritual life is as important as material life, if not more so. These findings consistently suggest that there has been a growing trend of Chinese people focusing on happiness, and the spiritual life and “little joys” of daily life are becoming increasingly recognized as sources of happiness since 1950s.

Human: Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses? Assistant:,"The answer to this question is that cash is not as liquid as other assets, and therefore may not be as readily available to use in the event of potential losses. However, other assets such as stocks, bonds, and property may be more readily available to use as capital. Additionally, using cash as capital may be seen as a risky move, as it may not provide the same level of protection against potential losses as other assets."

Human: Can you tell my a story about nuclear physics like dr Seuss? Assistant:,"There’s a place called Futurizon where robots are born. Futurizon is a special place, you see. It’s run by Dr Z who’s really clever. He’s found a way to make robots out of atoms, and they’re very special indeed.

At first, they’re all just babies. They cry and cry because they’re so new, but Dr Z and his team are always there to help them. They call it ‘nuclear physics’, but it’s not really like anything you’ve ever seen before.

The robots are born with a special code that makes them unique. This code tells them what they are and what they can do. Some are very small and can fit in the palm of your hand. Others are huge and can move a mountain.

One of the most important things that the robots learn is how to think for themselves. This is where the code comes in really handy. It tells them what to think about, but it doesn’t tell them what to think. This gives them the freedom to make their own decisions.

The robots also learn how to work together. They’re all born with different skills, but they need to work as a team if they’re going to achieve anything. This is where the code comes in again. It tells them how to communicate with each other, and how to work towards the same goal.

Finally, the robots learn how to be good citizens. They’re born with a code that tells them what’s right and wrong, and they learn how to follow this code from Dr Z and his team. They learn about things like honesty, respect and kindness, and they try to live up to these values every day.

So, that’s what Futurizon is all about. It’s a place where robots are born, and they’re given the chance to be the best that they can be. It’s a special place, and it’s run by people who care about the robots that they create. And it all started with Dr Z and his team of brilliant scientists."

I love the way that movies can take us to different worlds and allow us to experience things that we might not otherwise be able to. When I discovered that I could direct, I knew that this was the perfect way to combine my love of storytelling with my passion for creating.

The question ""What challenges have you faced as a woman in the film industry?""The director replied, ""There have been many challenges, both as a woman and as a director. One of the biggest challenges that I've faced is the lack of support that is often available to women in this industry. It can be difficult to get funding for your projects, and even when you do, you often find that you are up against a lot of other talented women. Additionally, there is still a lot of sexism in the film industry, and women often find themselves facing unfair treatment and criticism.

The question ""How do you hope to inspire the next generation of female filmmakers?""The director replied, ""I hope to inspire the next generation of female filmmakers by showing them that they can achieve anything that they set their minds to. I believe that everyone has the potential to be a great filmmaker, regardless of their gender, and I want to help break down the barriers that are often put in the way of women in this industry. I also hope to inspire them by sharing the stories of other successful female filmmakers, and by showing them the many different ways that you can approach this craft.

The question ""What advice would you give to someone who is starting out in the film industry?""The director replied, ""The first piece of advice that I would give is to never give up. This industry can be tough, and it's easy to get discouraged, but if you love what you're doing, then you have to keep going. The second piece of advice is to be prepared to work hard. This industry is all about hard work and dedication, so you need to be ready to put in the time and effort if you want to succeed. Finally, I would say that it's important to always be learning and to never stop trying to improve. The film industry is constantly changing, and you need to be able to adapt if you want to keep up."

"Human: Why is it that only proteins, carbohydrates and fats are deemed to have caloric value?<br>Just to clarify - consider the hypothetical situation below:<br>100g of 'carbohydrates' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'protein' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'fat' = 900kCal<br>100g of 'vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes' = ? Assistant:","The question is, why is it that only proteins, carbohydrates and fats are deemed to have caloric value?<br>Just to clarify - consider the hypothetical situation below:<br>100g of 'carbohydrates' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'protein' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'fat' = 900kCal<br>100g of 'vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes' =? 

There are a few reasons why only proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are considered to have caloric value. 

First, proteins are essential for the growth and repair of tissues in the body. They are also used to produce enzymes and hormones, which are necessary for the proper functioning of the body. 

Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy. They are easily digested and absorbed, and can be used to fuel the body's cells. 

Fats are also an important source of energy for the body. They are stored in the body as reserves, and can be released to the body for use as energy when needed. 

All of these macronutrients have a role to play in the body, and are essential for good health. However, it is important to remember that not all foods contain all three of these macronutrients. For example, some foods are high in protein but low in carbohydrates, or vice versa. It is important to eat a variety of foods to ensure that you are getting all of the nutrients that your body needs."

"Human: How well does the following response respond to the prompt? ..... Prompt=  

After reading Lalor’s Chapter 8 as well as Goode’s explanation of curriculum evaluation necessity and models, explain what your school does to evaluate curriculum. Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? 

Response=  

In Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   

I would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.

Human: define a new language that contains words that are with numbers and letters such as 'IL9op' Assistant:,"It's impossible to define a new language that contains words that are with numbers and letters such as ‘IL9op’. However, a possible way to define such a language is by creating a set of rules that govern the formation of words and sentences. This could include rules for combining letters and numbers, as well as rules for the use of grammar and punctuation. Once the rules have been established, the language can be used to create words and sentences just like any other language."

- Startup cost: say we are starting at FireFly Burger restaurant, we have 7 branches all over Jordan, we will install two monitors of 15.6” in each branch as a start, this will cost us $250 per screen, 250*2*7= $3500. System development cost will be $0 since we all have programming background, especially in the needed language (C#). Our database is cloud-based and free for 20k operations/day, it will be increased if needed, $0.05/10k operations. 

- Fixed cost: it’s a one-time installation, and software will be updated automatically. 

- Variable costs: we will not have free installation for the kiosk, and having a well-implemented system will do the advertising job for us since we chose a busy place. But for the first couple of months we will have an employee in each branch explaining to people how to use the system so these employees will get paid around $400/month. (or we could pay extra for an employee who is already working in the restaurant to explain to people).

Total: 3500+2*400*7  = $9100 



-The percentage taken from each purchase (food order) of the KIOSK device that is in the possession of the restaurants purchasing the device (this is variable). Selling each unit for $400, our revenue will be $150/screen.

- Percentage taken from monthly maintenance cost.
      

                                                                                                        


 Assistant:","The cost of the KIOSK device will be $400. The cost of the monthly server will be $50. The cost of the employees will be $500/month. The cost of the software will be $50/month. The amount of money that will be taken from each purchase will be 5% (Revenue from food order). The amount of money that will be taken from the monthly server cost will be 5% (5% of the monthly server cost). The amount of money that will be taken from the employees' salary will be 5% (5% of the employees' salary). The amount of money that will be taken from the software cost will be 5% (5% of the software cost). The total cost of the KIOSK will be: 400 + 50 + 500 + 50 + 50 = 1000. The amount of money that will be taken from each purchase will be 5% of the amount of the purchase. If the food order is worth $15, then 5% of $15 is $0.75. The amount that will be taken from the purchase will be $0.75. The food order cost will be $15. The cost of the food order will be $14.75. The KIOSK will have a profit of $0.75 on each food order. The KIOSK will have a profit of $0.75 on each purchase. The KIOSK will have a profit of $112.25/month. The KIOSK will have a profit of $112.25/5% = $2,000/month. The KIOSK will have a profit of $2,000/month. The KIOSK will have a profit of $2,000/month"
"Human: Marie is at the music store for a store day. She bought two $50 combos. Then, for $25 she bought two t-shirts for $5 each and five hoodies for $2 each. Then, she bought sneakers for $8 each.

Human: How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge Assistant:,"Several instance segmentation AP metrics exist, such as Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice score, and Jaccard index. However, these metrics do not take into account the human knowledge of the annotator. In this article, we present a method to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge. We first annotate a set of ground truth masks for a given dataset. We then use a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach to automatically generate a set of improved ground truth masks. The improved ground truth masks are then used to train a deep neural network for instance segmentation. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the instance segmentation algorithm using the improved ground truth masks."
Human: what is needed for self-sufficient living spaces Assistant:,"Self-sufficient living spaces can be made up of various types of structures, such as homes, apartments, or even tiny houses. There are a few key things that are needed in order to make a self-sufficient living space work. 

One of the most important things is to have a good understanding of the space and how it works. This means knowing things like how much sunlight the space gets, what kind of insulation it has, and what kind of heating and cooling system is in place. Once you have a good understanding of the space, you can start to think about how to make it self-sufficient. 

There are a few different things that can be done in order to make a living space self-sufficient. One is to make sure that it has a good energy-efficient design. This means using materials that are good insulators, and designing the space so that it uses energy as efficiently as possible. 

Another thing that can be done is to install solar panels or other renewable energy systems. This will allow the space to generate its own electricity, and reduce its reliance on non-renewable energy sources. 

Finally, it is important to make sure that the living space is properly equipped with appliances and systems that will allow it to be self-sufficient. This may include things like a composting toilet, a rainwater harvesting system, and a food storage and preparation area."
"Human: proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.
However, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.
As a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.
From the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.
All in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.
During my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.
My self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.
In short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.
These difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.
Kevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.
Human self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.
This suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.
The relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.
In my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.
Also, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?
These reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.
My creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.
My artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.
From a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.
I have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.
Often times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.
While a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.
Therefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.
In the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.
Therefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression
In short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.
Among my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.
In the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.
I experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.
In the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.
I found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.
I was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay ""Glitch Feminism,"" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of ""destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse"" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.
I tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.
In this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.
I believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.
In addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.
I began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.
Balloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.
I create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.

For me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.
My work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.
In conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works. Assistant:",Yes

Human: Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking Assistant:,"Inconsistency arises when our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors don't match. When we try to be something we're not or act in a way that contradicts our beliefs, we create inconsistencies. Ideological thinking is a way of thinking that is based on certain principles or beliefs. It can lead to a rigid and inflexible worldview. When we are ideological, we often don't consider other perspectives or options. This can create inconsistencies because our beliefs may not align with the facts or reality. For example, a conservative might claim that they are all about freedom and individualism, but then oppose gay marriage because it goes against their beliefs. The inconsistency lies in the fact that the conservative is claiming to be one thing, but acting in a way that contradicts that claim."
Human: Why do people give Reddit Gold to admins? Assistant:,"It's difficult to pin down an exact answer for this question, as there are many different reasons why people might choose to give Reddit Gold to admins. However, some of the most common reasons include:

Showing appreciation: Many people give Reddit Gold to admins as a way of saying thank you for their hard work and dedication. Admins often spend a lot of time moderating the site, fighting spam, and ensuring that everything runs smoothly, and receiving Gold from users is a way of acknowledging the time and effort that they put in.

Showing support: Giving Reddit Gold is also a way of showing support for the admins who support the things you care about. If you're a fan of a particular subreddit, for example, you might give Gold to the admins of that subreddit to show your backing.

Showing disagreement: Some people give Reddit Gold to admins as a way of disagreeing with their decisions. If you're unhappy with the way that an admin is moderating a subreddit, for example, you might give them Gold as a way of voicing your disapproval.

Overall, there are many different reasons why people might choose to give Reddit Gold to admins. It's a way of showing appreciation, support, and disagreement, and it's a way of contributing to the running of the site."

Human: What does Nassim Nicholas Taleb say about market efficiency? Assistant:,"Market efficiency is a necessary condition for the existence of a market, but it is not a sufficient condition. In other words, a market can be efficient in terms of the first part of the definition, but it may not be efficient in terms of the second part. 
There are a few different ways to define market efficiency. One common definition is that a market is efficient if all the information that could possibly affect the prices of the assets in the market is already reflected in the prices. In other words, the prices of the assets are ""correct"" in the sense that they reflect all the available information. 
Another way to define market efficiency is to say that a market is efficient if it is impossible to make a profit by trading in the market. In this definition, a market is ""correct"" in the sense that it does not allow arbitrageur to take advantage of inefficiencies in the market. 
There are a few different ways to test for market efficiency. One common test is to look at the relationship between the prices of the assets and the available information. If the prices are correctly reflecting the available information, then the market is likely to be efficient. Another test is to look at the relationship between the prices of the assets and the trading volume. If the prices are correctly reflecting the available information, then the market is likely to be efficient."

"Human: 6Rephrase this article into a third person and conversational and very unique 2000 words article include a headings about  Based on our investigation so far, Reddit user passwords and accounts are safe, but on Sunday night (pacific time), Reddit systems were hacked as a result of a sophisticated and highly-targeted phishing attack. They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.

What Happened?
On late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.

After successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).

Exposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.

How Did We Respond?
Soon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.

Our goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.

User Account Protection
Since we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.

Also: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!

…AMA!
The team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions. Since our investigation is still ongoing and this is about our security practices, we can’t necessarily answer everything in great detail, but we’ll do our best to live up to Default Open here.

Human: who was the black cabinet member who went on to play an important role in the civil rights movement Assistant:,"There is no single answer to the question of who the ""black cabinet member"" is, as there have been several black individuals who have served in this role throughout history. However, one notable example is Thurgood Marshall, who served as a member of the United States Supreme Court from 1967 to 1995.

Marshall was born in Maryland in 1907, and in 1932 graduated from Howard University Law School. He then moved to New York City, where he began working as a lawyer for the NAACP. In 1936, he was appointed as the first black attorney in the NAACP's Washington, D.C. office.

In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson appointed Marshall to the United States Supreme Court, becoming the first black justice in the court's history. He served on the court for 24 years, during which time he played a key role in many important cases, including Brown v. Board of Education and Brown v. Allen.

After retiring from the Supreme Court, Marshall continued to be involved in civil rights activism, and in 1989 was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He died in 1995 at the age of 86."
"Human: 2 / 2Create a 2000 words article conversational article and Rephrase this with 100% no plagiarism and unique For the past month or so, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has received much attention within the tech community. ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.

Microsoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).
Microsoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.

Of course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.

This includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.

Microsoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023
During the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.

“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.

Microsoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.

The chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.

Windows 12 AI camera feature
Portrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI
Panos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.

“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.

Major versions of Windows to ship every three years
Microsoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.

Windows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.

After 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).

We should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.

Microsoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.

There’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.

But keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.


And so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.


Just consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.

“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”

(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)

What might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.

Ten billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!

It’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.

Windows AI chips
Microsoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.

Parts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.

Theoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.

What can we expect from AI in Windows?
Panay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.

That’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.

But it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.

For Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.

The other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.

Microsoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”

Back then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.

How bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, ""I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine."" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, ""Even a piece of junk will qualify"" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, ""We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.""

I’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.

"Human: Mill vs Gartner
This case is about a dispute over the right to dig clay on a piece of land. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a ""parol license,"" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.

Smith vs Mill Company
The case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.

Gartner vs Baker
The case of ""Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell"" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.

Human: Why is it a bad idea to give a mouse a cookie? Assistant:,"It's impossible to pin down a single answer that fits all scenarios for this question. 

However, some reasons why it is a bad idea to give a mouse a cookie could include the fact that cookies are typically small and easily digestible, which makes them a bad food choice for a larger animal like a mouse. Additionally, cookies may not provide the mouse with all of the nutrients that it needs to survive, and giving a mouse too many cookies could actually be harmful to its health."
Human: which second messenger molecule acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions Assistant:,"The second messenger molecule that acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions is IP3. IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) is a molecule that is produced when an IP3 receptor protein is stimulated. When IP3 is produced, it dissociates from the IP3 receptor protein and enters the cytosol. In the cytosol, IP3 binds to a protein called Sar1, which then releases calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum. This release of calcium ions is important for activating enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum and for initiating a variety of cellular responses."
Human: How can anti-deressants make people think or act suicidally? Suicidal thoughts or actions' are a side effect of every single anti-depressant I've seen. Is the medicine controlling your mind or something? Assistant:,"There are a number of ways that anti-deressants can make people think or act suicidally. One possibility is that the medication is causing people to experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors as a side effect. Another possibility is that the anti-deressants are actually making the depression worse, which can also lead to suicidal ideation and action.

It's important to note that not all people who take anti-deressants will experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors. However, it is a serious risk that should be taken into consideration before starting treatment. If you are considering taking an anti-depressant, it is important to talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits, including the risk of suicidal ideation and action."

Human: Draft a ministerial speech outlining the top five benefits that innovation brings to the Australian economy Assistant:,"Innovation is key to unlocking Australia's full economic potential. It has the power to transform our economy, create new industries and jobs, and improve the standard of living for all Australians. In this speech, I will outline the top five benefits that innovation brings to the Australian economy.

First, innovation drives economic growth. It creates new products and services, and makes existing products and services more efficient and effective. This, in turn, leads to increased productivity and economic output. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, research and development (R&D) expenditure in Australia grew by 8.4 per cent in 2018-19, reaching $43.5 billion. This is a clear indication that our nation is committed to innovation and investing in the future.

Second, innovation creates jobs. As new products and services are developed, new industries and businesses are created, creating job opportunities for Australians. According to the Australian Industry and Skills Committee, the R&D and innovation sectors employed 241,200 Australians in 2018-19, an increase of 9.6 per cent since 2014-15. This growth in employment demonstrates the important role that innovation plays in creating jobs and supporting economic growth.

Third, innovation improves our standard of living. As new products and services are developed, they make our lives easier, safer and more comfortable. For example, innovations in medical technology have improved our health outcomes and extended our lifespans. Inventions in transportation have made our commutes shorter and our travel times more efficient. And innovations in communication have connected us with people and information all over the world. All of these advancements have had a positive impact on our standard of living.

Fourth, innovation drives competitiveness. In today's global economy, innovation is essential for businesses to remain competitive. Those that fail to innovate risk falling behind their competitors, losing market share and ultimately, failing to survive. In recent years, Australia has made great strides in improving its innovation capabilities, and this has paid off. Our country is now ranked 14th in the world for innovation, up from 18th in 2012. This improvement in our ranking demonstrates that our nation is becoming more competitive as a result of its investment in innovation.

Fifth, innovation benefits society as a whole. Innovation has the power to address some of the world's most pressing challenges, from climate change to healthcare. For example, innovations in renewable energy technology are helping to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change. And innovations in medical technology"

Human: Write a section for an award application detailing how photography has insipired you Assistant:,"Photography has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. It started out as a hobby, but it has since evolved into so much more. For me, photography is not just about taking pictures. It's about capturing a moment in time and preserving it for eternity. It's about being able to look back on a memory and relive it as if it were happening all over again. And it's about being able to share those memories with others.

There have been so many moments in my life that photography has inspired me. One of the most special moments was when I was given my first camera. I was so excited to finally be able to take pictures, and I spent hours taking photos of everything and anything. I even started taking pictures of the people around me, and they loved it. It was then that I realized how much of an impact photography could have on people's lives.

Another moment that photography inspired me was when I was given the opportunity to take a photography course. I had never taken a photography course before, but I was excited to learn. I spent hours in the darkroom, perfecting my skills. I also started taking pictures of people again, and I found that I was able to capture their personalities and emotions in the photographs. It was then that I realized how much of an impact I could have on people's lives through my photography.

The most recent moment that photography inspired me was when I was given the opportunity to travel to a different country and take photographs. I had never been to another country before, but I was excited to experience something new. I spent weeks researching the country and the culture, and I was able to capture so many amazing photographs. I also met so many people, and I was able to learn about their lives and their cultures. It was then that I realized how much of an impact I could have on people's lives through my photography."
"Human: I want to eventually become a plant/manufacturing/production manager, and eventually a Chief Operating Officer. What sort of experience and post-graduate education path would you recommend? Please provide non-obvious and atypical career paths leading to such positions, on top of the classic ones. Assistant:","There are a number of routes that can be taken to achieve a career as a plant/manufacturing/production manager, and eventually a Chief Operating Officer. One option is to start by obtaining a bachelor's degree in a field such as engineering, business administration, or operations management. This will provide a solid foundation in the skills and knowledge needed for these types of positions.

Once you have obtained your bachelor's degree, you will need to gain experience in the field. This can be done by working in entry-level positions such as production worker, manufacturing engineer, or quality control inspector. It is important to work your way up in these positions, so that you can gain the necessary experience and skills.

Another way to gain experience is to intern with a company. This will give you the opportunity to work with professionals in the field, and learn about the day-to-day operations of a company. Many companies offer internships to students, so it is important to look for these opportunities.

Once you have gained the necessary experience, you will need to obtain a master's degree in a field such as engineering, business administration, or operations management. This will provide you with the advanced knowledge and skills needed to move up in your career.

Human: explain the basics of area and perimeter Assistant:,"The first step in explaining the basics of area and perimeter is to define what each term means. In area, the number of square units a shape covers is measured. In perimeter, the number of units that border a shape is measured.

The second step is to provide an example of each. For example, a rectangle has a known area and perimeter. The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the length by the width, and the perimeter can be calculated by adding the length of all four sides.

The third step is to explain that the area of a shape can be changed by changing the size of the shape, or by changing the shape itself. The perimeter of a shape will always be the same, regardless of the size or shape of the object.

The fourth step is to provide some tips for calculating area and perimeter. For example, to find the area of a rectangle, multiply the length by the width. To find the perimeter of a rectangle, add up the length of all four sides.

The fifth step is to provide some real-life examples of shapes and their areas and perimeters. For example, the area of a circle is the same as the area of a square that has the same side length as the circle. The perimeter of a circle is always equal to 2 times the radius of the circle.

The final step is to provide some additional resources for learning more about area and perimeter."

"Human: cost of fuel for a 14 mile journey in a car with 48mpg, fuel costs 625 pence per gallon and there is heavy traffic for half the journey Assistant:","The cost of fuel for a 14 mile journey in a car with 48mpg, fuel costs 625 pence per gallon and there is heavy traffic for half the journey would depend on the specific car in question, as different cars have different mpg ratings. However, assuming a specific car with a 48mpg rating, the cost of fuel for a 14 mile journey in that car with heavy traffic for half the journey would be around £4.08. This is calculated by multiplying the car's mpg rating by the number of miles travelled, then multiplying the result by the cost of petrol per gallon, then dividing by 2 (since there is half the usual traffic). This gives a total cost of fuel of £8.16, which is then divided by 2 to give a cost of £4.08 per mile."

"Human: How does money go from my pocket, through the stock market, and to support the business I've bought stock from? Assistant:","The answer to this isn't a straightforward one. There are a number of ways that money can go from someone's pocket to a company's stock market value, and vice versa. In general, though, there are a few key ways that this relationship works:

When someone buys a stock, they are essentially buying a small piece of ownership in the company. The value of this ownership (i.e. the stock price) can go up or down depending on a number of factors, including the company's financial performance, the state of the economy, and investor sentiment.

If the company performs well and its financials are strong, the value of its stock is likely to go up. This is because investors are willing to pay more for a piece of the company, in order to share in its profits. Conversely, if the company performs poorly and its financials are weak, the value of its stock is likely to go down. This is because investors are less willing to pay for a piece of the company, in order to share in its losses.

In addition to the company's financial performance, the state of the economy also plays a role in the stock market. In general, the stock market tends to go up when the economy is doing well, and goes down when the economy is struggling. This is because investors are more likely to invest their money in stocks (i.e. take on risk) when the economy is doing well, and less likely to invest in stocks (i.e. take on less risk) when the economy is struggling.

Finally, investor sentiment also plays a role in the stock market. This refers to the overall mood or attitude of investors towards the stock market and the companies that are listed on it. If investors are optimistic about the future of the stock market and the companies in it, they are more likely to buy stocks and drive up the market. Conversely, if investors are pessimistic about the future of the stock market and the companies in it, they are more likely to sell stocks and drive down the market."

Additionally, there are many English language learning websites and apps that provide exercises and practice materials."
Human: Why does warmth make you feel tired? Assistant:,"It's pretty simple - when our bodies are warm, our core temperature rises. When our core temperature rises, our blood vessels dilate, and our blood flow increases, particularly to our muscles. This increased blood flow can help make us feel more awake and alert, as well as more active. However, if our body temperature continues to rise, we may start to feel tired and sluggish. This is because our body has started to release hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can cause us to feel more tired and less alert."

Human: Explain me the Finite Elemente Method Assistant:,"The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical method for solving problems in physics and engineering. It is based on the idea of dividing a large, complex problem into a number of smaller, simpler problems, and then solving each of these problems individually. The solutions to the smaller problems are then combined to give a solution to the larger problem.

The FEM is used in a wide range of applications, including the design of aircraft and bridges, the analysis of electronic circuits, and the study of fluid dynamics. It is a powerful tool for solving problems that are difficult to solve analytically, and it is often used when the exact solution to a problem is not known.

The FEM involves the following steps:

1. The problem is divided into a number of smaller, simpler problems.

2. Each of the smaller problems is solved individually.

3. The solutions to the smaller problems are combined to give a solution to the larger problem.

4. The FEM is used to solve problems of any size or complexity, and it can be applied to problems in any field of physics or engineering."

Video Transcript: ""SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.""
Video Summary: Assistant:"," The author, Dr. Robert M. Grant, makes an interesting claim that the idea of inerrancy has been misused and misunderstood. He argues that the term inerrancy is too important to be given a simple and inaccurate definition. He also points out that the idea of infallibility is associated with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. He then gives his own definition of inerrancy, which includes the idea that the Bible is absolutely consistent with itself. He also points out that the term inerrancy must be carefully defined, and that it does not mean that the Bible is scientifically precise. He concludes by stating that the idea of inerrancy is too important to be given a simple and inaccurate definition."

Human: when are hops added to the brewing process? Assistant:,"The hops addition process varies depending on the type of beer being brewed. However, in general, hops are added to the brewing process in the late boil or conditioning stage. 

In the late boil stage, hops are added to the pot of boiling wort for a period of 15-60 minutes, depending on the desired level of hop bitterness. The wort is then removed from the hops and allowed to cool, at which point the yeast is added to begin the fermentation process. 

In the conditioning stage, hops may be added again, either as a dry hop (hop flowers added to the fermenting beer) or as a wet hop (hop flowers added to the fermenting beer or the finished beer). Dry hopping is becoming increasingly popular, as brewers have found that it allows them to add a greater variety of hop flavors and aromas to their beers."

"Human: Write ""Test"" Assistant:","There is no single answer to the question of what it means to be human. In many ways, being human is a complex and multifaceted concept that varies depending on who you ask. However, there are some key things that are generally accepted to be a part of what makes us human.

One of the most important things that makes us human is our ability to think and reason. We are capable of understanding abstract concepts and of making complex decisions. We are also able to learn from our experiences and to adapt to new situations.

Another important aspect of what makes us human is our capacity for emotion. We are able to experience a wide range of emotions, from happiness and love to sadness and anger. We are also able to empathize with others and to understand their feelings.

Yet another important part of what makes us human is our social nature. We are social creatures, and we thrive on interaction with other people. We are able to form strong bonds with others and to support and care for one another.

These are just a few of the things that make us human. In many ways, being human is about being able to live in a world that is full of complexity and uncertainty, and to find ways to make sense of it all. It is about being able to connect with others and to form meaningful relationships. And it is about being able to learn and grow and to adapt to changing circumstances."

Human: assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual Assistant:,"The answer to this question varies based on context, as the best way to be less reactive and use a pause ritual will vary from person to person. However, some tips on how to do this include taking a deep breath before responding to a situation, counting to ten before speaking, and reminding yourself to pause and think before reacting.

One way to develop this skill is to practice mindfulness meditation, which involves paying attention to the present moment and observing your thoughts and feelings without judgment. This can help you develop the ability to pause and reflect before reacting, and to respond to situations in a more calm and rational way.

Another way to develop this skill is to identify your triggers and develop a plan for how to respond to them. For example, if you are easily triggered by angry or upset people, you might try to distance yourself from them or find ways to diffuse the situation before it escalates.

Finally, it is important to be patient with yourself as you develop this skill. It can be difficult to stop reacting impulsively, especially if you are used to reacting in a certain way. However, with practice and patience, you can develop the ability to pause and reflect before reacting, and to respond to situations in a more calm and rational way."

How do I get backlinks?"" Assistant:","A backlink is a link from one website to another. Backlinks are important for SEO because they help search engines determine the authority and relevance of a website. A backlink from a high-authority website is worth more than a backlink from a low-authority website. 

There are two types of backlinks: dofollow and nofollow. A dofollow backlink is a backlink that allows search engines to follow the link and pass on the link juice. A nofollow backlink is a backlink that tells search engines not to follow the link and to not pass on the link juice. 

Dofollow backlinks are more important for SEO than nofollow backlinks. However, it is still important to have a mix of both dofollow and nofollow backlinks. 

There are many ways to get backlinks, but the most important way is to create high-quality content that other websites will want to link to. You can also get backlinks by guest posting on other websites, by creating infographics, and by using social media to promote your content.

Human: is queue an ADT or a data structure Assistant:,"Both a queue and an ADT are data structures, but an ADT is a general description of a data structure, while a queue is a specific type of data structure that has certain properties.

There are many different types of queues, each with its own specific use case. For example, a queue of numbers might be used to keep track of the order in which customers are served at a fast food restaurant. In this case, the queue would be an ADT, since it has the properties of a queue (i.e., it contains elements, it has a front and a back, and it can be"
"Human: Come up with 20 different push notification messages for a brand named Hush Blankets. Here is more information on the brand: 1. Sleep Better
Ever woken up not feeling rested at all? Weighted blankets can help. The weight automatically relaxes your nervous system, reducing cortisol (stress hormone) while increasing serotonin (happy hormone) and melatonin (sleepy hormone). So you get to sleep faster, sleep more deeply, and wake up refreshed.

ADHD
Sensory Processing
Disorder
2. Relax &amp; De-Stress

We want to be funny and make users enticed to click on the push notification and potentially buy our products. Make the messages seem somewhat conversational but short. Make them funny and have puns, I should laugh while reading them. Assistant:","Yes, of course! When crafting your marketing messages for your weightless weighted blanket, it's important to keep in mind who your target audience is and what will resonate with them. 

One way to make your messages seem conversational and funny is to use puns and play on words. For example, you could send a message that says, ""Are you feeling weighted down by your lack of rest? It's time to switch to our weightless weighted blanket for a more restful sleep!"" 

Another way to make your messages humorous is to use humor in your branding. For example, you could create a humorous logo or slogan for your brand, and then use that throughout your marketing messages. For example, you could send a message that says, ""Are you ready to hush, hush and get your rest? Then it's time to switch to our weightless weighted blanket!"" 

Ultimately, the key to making your marketing messages humorous and conversational is to be authentic and true to your brand. If you're a brand that is known for being humorous and playful, then make sure to incorporate that into your marketing messages. If you're a brand that is more serious and professional, then keep your messages more serious and professional."
"Human: In order to launch a token for a Defi project, I want to sell some tokens privately to early investors and then add it to a launchpad. let me know what can I do with my smart contract? Should I create a presale contract separate from main contract? Assistant:","It's hard to provide a blanket solution for this, as the best approach will vary depending on the specific details of your project. However, some things to consider when launching a token for a Defi project include the following:

- Whether or not to create a presale contract separate from the main contract. This will depend on the specifics of your project, but in general, you'll want to create a separate contract if you're planning to sell tokens to early investors. This will help keep the early-stage token distribution separate from the main distribution, and can help avoid complications down the line.

- Whether or not to use a launchpad. A launchpad can be a useful tool for distributing tokens to a wider audience, but it's not always necessary. If you're planning to sell tokens to a small group of early investors, you may be able to skip the launchpad and distribute the tokens directly."
Human: what is the recommended pattern for creating games in godot Assistant:,"There is no one recommended pattern for creating games in Godot. The Godot engine is open-source, which means that developers can create and share their own workflows and project templates. 

That being said, there are a few best practices that can be followed to create games in Godot. One important thing to keep in mind is the difference between a project and a game file. A project is a collection of game files, and is where you set up your project's settings and create your game's menus and other interface elements. A game file is where you actually code the game's logic and gameplay. 

Another thing to keep in mind is the difference between a node and a script. A node is a graphical object that represents a game object in the game editor. A script is a code file that contains the game's logic and gameplay. 

When creating a game in Godot, it's important to start by creating a new project and setting up your project's settings. Then, you can create a new game object and add it to the project. Next, you can add nodes to the game object to represent the game's objects and gameplay. Finally, you can add scripts to the game object to code the game's logic and gameplay."
Human: I want you to act as a Tiktok Ads Keywords generator. Your task is to come up with keywords that can be used in Tiktok advertising campaigns. The keywords should be relevant to the target audience and the product or service being advertised. Your responses should not include more than 5 keywords per request. Assistant:,"When generating a list of keywords for an advertising campaign, it is important to consider the target audience and the product or service being advertised. For example, if the target audience is teenagers, then keywords such as ""fun"", ""cool"", and ""trendy"" may be more relevant than ""serious"", ""professional"", or ""expensive"". Similarly, if the product is a new type of lipstick, then keywords such as ""beauty"", ""glamour"", and ""makeup"" may be more relevant than ""sports"", ""travel"", or ""food""."
Human: what are some basics of nutrition that i should be aware of Assistant:,"There are a lot of different opinions about what constitutes a ""healthy diet"". However, there are some basic principles that can be followed to help ensure that you are getting your nutrients in the right amounts.

The first is to make sure that you are eating a variety of foods. This will help ensure that you are getting all of the different nutrients that your body needs. The second is to focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods. These foods are typically more nutrient-dense than processed foods, meaning that they contain more nutrients for the calories. The third is to make sure that you are eating enough food. Many people do not eat enough, which can lead to nutrient deficiencies. The fourth is to make sure that you are eating the right balance of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats). This will vary depending on your individual needs, but in general, you will want to make sure that you are getting enough of each macronutrient. The fifth is to make sure that you are eating enough micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Again, this will vary depending on your individual needs, but in general, you will want to make sure that you are getting enough of each micronutrient."
Human: what would be a good idea for a quiz about omnichannel marketing on my website Assistant:,"There is no one answer to this question, as the best quiz for your website about omnichannel marketing will vary depending on your specific audience and goals. However, some tips on how to create an effective omnichannel marketing quiz include:

1. Start by creating a list of all the different omnichannel marketing strategies that you want to include in your quiz. This could include strategies such as social media marketing, email marketing, content marketing, and more.

2. Once you have your list of strategies, create a series of questions that relate to each of them. For example, you could have a question about the benefits of social media marketing, or the best way to use email marketing to reach your customers.

3. Make sure to include a variety of question types in your quiz, such as multiple choice, true/false, and open-ended questions. This will make it more interesting and engaging for your audience.

4. Finally, make sure to share your quiz on your website and through your social media channels. This will help to drive traffic to your site and encourage people to take the quiz."
"Human: I'm preparing a fun session with work colleagues in a tech company.

The circumstances must be funny yet respectful and safe for work. Please help me come up with a few of these circumstances. To help you, please consider this example: ""In 10 years time, who is the most likely to have won the lottery"" Assistant:","There are a number of funny future circumstances that could occur, depending on the team's sense of humor and what they find most amusing. Some possible scenarios could include:

- In 10 years' time, the team could be gathered around a person who has won the lottery, and is trying to decide what to do with all of their newfound wealth. They could vote on who is the most likely to have won the lottery, and who is the most likely to be in this situation.

Human: You will simulate an SEO expert. What keywords should a screenwriting software target Assistant:,"There are a few key phrases that could be targeted for a screenwriting software. Some possible options include ""screenwriting software"", ""screenplay software"", ""film scoring software"", and ""teleprompter software"". 

It's important to research the keywords that are being used in the screenwriting software industry to get a better idea of what phrases are most commonly used. This can be done by looking at the results of a keyword search. 

Once the keywords have been identified, they can be used to optimize the website's content. This includes the page title, meta description, headings, and body text. It's important to use the keywords naturally and not to overdo it, as this can be seen as spammy and hurt the website's ranking."

We have two industries, B2B SaaS and Ecommerce. Within SaaS, we are used by customer success teams. Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. 

Together with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. 

Description Accurat.ai
''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.

We believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.

Current practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.

On top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''

Please think of the person judging the application. Come up with a couple of ideas where Churned and Ocean can join forces, which we can use in the application

The instrumental breaks can be powerful and emotional, leading to the next verse or chorus. The song can end with a powerful chorus, or a softer instrumental section."
Human: Write a snoopdogg rap explaining how to not commit a warcrime Assistant:,"This question doesn't have a universal solution, as the best way to avoid committing a war crime will vary depending on the specific circumstances and situation. However, some tips on how to avoid committing a war crime include:

1. Always make sure you understand what a war crime is before you commit anything. This will help you avoid accidentally committing a crime.

2. Be aware of the potential consequences of your actions. War crimes are serious offenses, and committing one can have severe consequences.

3. Make sure you are acting in accordance with the law and the rules of engagement. War crimes are often committed as a result of misunderstandings or violations of the law.

4. If you are unsure whether your actions constitute a war crime, ask for clarification. It is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to war crimes.

5. If you do commit a war crime, stop and think about what you have done. It may be possible to mitigate the damage and avoid further consequences."
"Human: ""I am trying to win over a new client for my writing services and skinny brown dog media to as as a ghost writer for their book Unbreakable Confidence.

A publisher will handle all of the behind-the-scenes work, such as marketing and distribution, so that the author can focus on writing.

"Human: question about Computer architecture and organization 
for 6 marks
what in general terms is the distinction between computer organization and computer architecture ?
give answer in full sentence points if possible Assistant:","There is no single, universally accepted definition of the term ""computer architecture"". In general, computer architecture is the design of the physical and software components of a computer, and the interactions between them. It encompasses the high-level design of the computer's internal workings, as well as the low-level design of its hardware components.

There are a number of different perspectives from which to view the field of computer architecture. From a high-level perspective, computer architecture can be seen as the study of the design of computer systems. This includes the design of the hardware and software components of a computer, as well as the interactions between them. From a low-level perspective, computer architecture can be seen as the study of the design of individual computer components. This includes the design of the processor, memory, and input/output devices.

The field of computer architecture is concerned with a number of different issues, including the design of efficient and effective computer systems, the design of computer components that are compatible with each other, and the design of computer systems that are reliable and secure."
"Human: i'm working on a spatial analysis project and am looking for questions I can answer with it related housing and crime analysis, do you have suggestions?  Assistant:","There are a number of ways to approach this question, but one way would be to use a spatial autocorrelation estimator such as Moran's I. In order to do this, you would first need to have data on both housing and crime for each location in the country. You would then calculate the Moran's I for each indicator for each location. Finally, you would create a heat map of the results.

Another way to approach this question is to use a spatial econometric model. In order to do this, you would first need to have data on both housing and crime for each location in the country. You would then need to identify any spatially lagged effects. This could be done by looking at the spatial autocorrelation of the indicators over time. You would then fit a spatial econometric model to the data. This could include models such as a spatial error model, a spatial panel data model, or a spatio-temporal econometric model.

You could also use a Geographic Information System (GIS) to answer this question. In order to do this, you would first need to have data on both housing and crime for each location in the country. You would then overlay this data onto a map. This would allow you to see where the highest concentrations of crime and the highest concentrations of housing are located. You could then identify any spatial patterns in the data. This could include patterns such as clustering, aggregation, or isolation."

Human: What's the permission that allows creating provisioning profiles in Apple Developer account is called? Assistant:,"There is no single ""permission"" that allows creating provisioning profiles in an Apple Developer account. The process of creating provisioning profiles involves several distinct steps, all of which must be completed in order to generate a provisioning profile that can be used to sign and distribute your application.

The first step in creating a provisioning profile is to create a new iOS or Mac OS X provisioning profile in the Apple Developer portal. To do this, you will need to create a new organization in the portal and add the team members who will be responsible for signing and distributing your application.

Once you have created the provisioning profile, you will need to add your app to the provisioning profile by specifying the bundle ID of your app. You will also need to add any necessary entitlements to the provisioning profile.

Once you have added your app to the provisioning profile, you can generate the provisioning profile by clicking the ""Generate"" button in the provisioning profile editor. The provisioning profile will be available for download from the Apple Developer portal.

If you are using a third-party tool to sign your application, you will need to add the provisioning profile to the tool in order to generate an application that can be signed with the provisioning profile."
"Human: I am an aikido teacher and student of Tomita Seiji who is living in Belgium. I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way? Assistant:","There are many possible aproaches to teaching aikido based on the educational ideas of J Krishnamurti. Here are a few suggestions:

1) Focus on the relationship between the teacher and the student. Krishnamurti believed that the teacher should be a guide, not a authority. In aikido class, this means that the teacher should be there to help the students learn, but should never try to dominate them.

2) Emphasize the importance of self-reflection. Krishnamurti believed that the only way to really learn was to reflect on one’s own experiences. In aikido class, this means that the students should be encouraged to think about what they are learning, and to ask questions.

3) Create a safe, non-judgmental environment. Krishnamurti believed that people were more likely to open up and be themselves in an environment where they felt safe and accepted. In aikido class, this means that the students should be able to try new things without fear of ridicule or punishment."

She wore her heart on her sleeve, and didn't hold nothing back.

But she had a strength within, that set her apart.

She was the woman who stood up, for what was right and due.
She was the woman who never, ever gave in,
She was the woman who lived her life, with nothing in mind.

She was the woman who inspired, the woman who amazed,
The woman who showed us, what we are truly made of.
On this day, we celebrate, the woman who shines so bright,
The woman who is brave, and the woman who's right.

So here's to the women, who make our world a better place,
The women who never give up, and the women who take a race.
For we are all women, and we are all the same,
So let us celebrate, the women who are so divine."

Human: Why did the building of a pipeline have to be voted on by the government(USA)? Doesn't this infringe on government interfering with private corporations?<br> Assistant:,"There is no specific law that the building of a pipeline must be voted on by the government. However, the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate the transportation of goods. This includes pipelines. When a pipeline is proposed, the government must decide whether or not to regulate it. If the government decides to regulate the pipeline, it must vote on the matter. This is done to ensure that the government is making the decision about the pipeline, and not private corporations."

"Human: i assume you are familiar with the Drake equation. Can you give estimates and error margins for each of its parameters, then calculate the result including error bounds. Assistant:","The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations that may exist in our galaxy. It was proposed by astronomer Frank Drake in 1961. The equation is as follows:

N = (1/2) * (1 / (fc * τ))^α * ln((1+ρ) / (1-ρ)) / (M * ρ * τ)

where:
- N is the number of civilizations
- fc is the fraction of planets that develop intelligent life
- τ is the time a civilization is likely to exist
- α is the average number of planets that a civilization will develop on
- ln is the natural logarithm
- ρ is the probability that a civilizations' technology will be able to detect another civilization's signal
- M is the number of planets in the Milky Way galaxy

The error margin for each parameter is as follows:

- fc: 0.0125 to 0.5
- τ: 0.1 to 100
- α: 1 to 10
- ln: 0 to infinity
- ρ: 0 to 1

Therefore, the estimate for the number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy is:

N = (1/2) * (1 / (fc * τ))^α * ln((1+ρ) / (1-ρ)) / (M * ρ * τ)

This equation can be used to calculate the number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy, given the values of the parameters. However, the equation is probabilistic, so the results should be taken as estimates rather than exact values."
"Human: Summarize this:<br><br>Don't Chase Money, Chase Your Purpose, The Money Will Follow - KERWIN RAE - YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you [Music]<br> Assistant:",No music

Assistant:,"The horror movie set on the island Sylt in northern Germany in the 19th century, revolves around the activities of a small community that is slowly being driven insane by a sinister force. The island is home to a number of fishermen, who rely on the sea for their livelihood. One day, a ship arrives at the island, carrying a cargo that includes barrels of human blood. The blood spills onto the island, contaminating the water and the soil. Soon, the inhabitants of the island begin to act strangely. They start to attack each other, and their loved ones.

Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.
 Assistant:","A single pane window can be more efficient than a double pane window. A double pane window has an R-value of 5.6, while a single pane window has an R-value of 1. A lower R-value means greater insulation. The R-value of a window is determined by the amount of glass and spacer used. A single pane window has less glass and spacer than a double pane window."
Human: How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment? Assistant:,"Kahane's advocacy of violence against Jews echoes the ethics of Fanon and Zizek. In all three thinkers, the violence is justified in the face of what they perceive as an oppressive and illegitimate Jewish Establishment. Fanon and Zizek both argue that the Jews have used violence against non-Jews as a means of maintaining their own power, and that the only way to challenge this power is through violence. Kahane takes this argument a step further, advocating specifically for violence against Jews. He argues that Jews are responsible for the oppression of non-Jews, and that the only way to end this oppression is through the violent overthrow of the Jewish Establishment."

"Human: Rewrite the given introductory paragraph so that it starts with a pertinent anecdote. Also rewrite the thesis so that it is succinct and concise:    ""Many types of black people have different cultural backgrounds and experiences. For example, African and African American cultures share a common ancestry and history of struggles but have distinct cultural identities. While both groups are considered Black, they have different experiences, records, and cultural practices. As Saint Augustine said, “The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.” This quote emphasizes the importance of exploring other cultures to understand their experiences better. As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals."" Assistant:","An anecdote about a trip to the doctor: 

One time, I went to the doctor for a check-up. The doctor asked me about my medical history and then asked me about my family's medical history. I was confused, but then the doctor explained that he wanted to make sure that I didn't have any genetic diseases that my family might also have. He then asked me about my diet and exercise habits. I was a little embarrassed, but then I realized that the doctor was just trying to help me live a healthier life.

The doctor finished asking his questions and then started to write down some things on his computer. He then showed me a graph that showed my cholesterol levels and blood pressure. I was surprised to see that my cholesterol levels were a little high and my blood pressure was a little high too. The doctor explained that I needed to eat healthier food and exercise more. He then gave me some tips on how to do that."
Human: explain TypeScript and Duck Typing Assistant:,"Duck Typing Assistant is an online tool that checks if a string is similar to another string. The tool works by comparing the characters in the strings, and if there are any differences, it returns false. If there are no differences, it returns true.

Duck Typing Assistant is based on the concept of duck typing. Duck typing is a programming paradigm that allows a program to determine the type of an object by the way it behaves, rather than by its type signature. In other words, if an object ""ducks"" like a duck, it is considered to be of type ""duck"".

Duck Typing Assistant is a useful tool for checking if a string is similar to another string. If the strings are similar, it means that they ""duck"" like a duck. However, if the strings are not similar, it means that they do not ""duck"" like a duck."

African Agriculture"" by Jean-Claude Devèze Assistant:","The challenges for African agriculture are many, but some of the most pressing include food security, climate change, and rural-urban migration. Food security is a major concern for Africa, as the continent struggles to produce enough food to feed its growing population. Climate change is also having a significant impact on African agriculture, with rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns affecting crop yields and livestock production. Finally, rural-urban migration is another challenge for the sector, as many people are moving from the countryside to the cities in search of work, often leaving behind their farms and rural livelihoods."

If the issue persists, it may be necessary to contact the Anki support team for further assistance."
"Human: how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it? Assistant:","Climate change is a serious threat that will have far-reaching consequences if we don't take action. The most pressing threat posed by climate change is the potential for more frequent and severe natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. These disasters will not only cause damage and loss of life, but they will also disrupt our communities and economies.

Another threat posed by climate change is the impact on our health. Rising temperatures will lead to more heatwaves and air pollution, which will put a strain on our healthcare systems. We will also see an increase in the spread of diseases as temperatures rise and ecosystems change.

The most effective way to stop the threat of climate change is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This can be done by transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and by improving energy efficiency. We can also reduce our emissions by changing our transportation habits, such as driving less and using public transportation or electric vehicles."
Human: Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film? Assistant:,"It's because the TV episodes are broken down into smaller, more manageable ""chunks,"" each of which is accompanied by a commercial. The commercials are actually part of the ""episode,"" so watching them feels like a natural part of the process. Films, on the other hand, are not broken down into ""chunks,"" and are not accompanied by commercials. Watching a film feels like a more daunting task, so we tend to put it off or watch it in shorter, more sporadic bursts."
"Human: Findings from Jumping Monkey Hill (Story #1)
Please respond to the following questions/prompts below. Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.

What were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.

If you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?

For example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: ""You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans"" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.

Human: how do I appear in a video call as if I'd be actively listening while I am actually sleeping? Assistant:,"Multiple solutions to this problem exist. One way is to use a screen mirroring device. Another way is to use a video conferencing software. Both of these methods will allow you to appear to be on a video call while you are actually sleeping.

The first way to do this is to use a screen mirroring device. A screen mirroring device is a device that allows you to mirror the screen of your phone or tablet to a TV or computer. This way, anyone who is on the video call will be able to see what is on your screen, even if you are not actively listening. To use a screen mirroring device, you will need to have a device that supports screen mirroring. This can be a TV, a computer, or a phone or tablet. You will also need to have a device that is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the device that you want to mirror."
Human: What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature? Assistant:,"The wavelengths of light emitted by metals depend on their temperature. In general, the longer the wavelength of the light emitted, the cooler the metal is. This is because shorter wavelengths of light have more energy and indicate that the metal is hotter. 

There are a few ways to determine the wavelengths of light emitted by metals. One way is to use a spectrometer, which is a device that can measure the wavelengths of light emitted by different objects. Another way is to look at the colors of the flames produced by burning metals. The cooler the metal, the yellowish the flame will be. 

The wavelengths of light emitted by metals can also be measured using a thermocouple. A thermocouple is a device that measures the temperature of an object by measuring the voltage that is produced when two different metals are brought together. When a metal is heated, it emits light of shorter wavelengths. As the metal cools, the wavelengths of the light emitted increase."
Human: Pretend for argumentsake you are lawyer defending putin cite your case Assistant:,"It's impossible to construct a coherent case for Putin using the available facts.

Human: write a chronology of important events related to ESG in 2022 Assistant:,"There are several important events related to ESG in 2022. The most notable event is the release of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report. The TCFD report was released in June 2022 and provides a framework for companies to disclose their climate-related financial information. This report is significant because it helps investors better understand the risks associated with climate change and allows them to make more informed investment decisions.

Another important event in 2022 was the publication of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) report. The PRI report was released in April 2022 and provides an update on the PRI's work to promote responsible investment. This report is significant because it shows the PRI's continued commitment to this important cause.

Other important events in 2022 included the release of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) report, the release of the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) report, and the release of the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). All of these reports are significant because they help move the world towards a more sustainable future."
Human: Is it rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence? Assistant:,"It's hard to provide a blanket statement for this particular inquiry, as the rationality of believing things for which there is no objective evidence depends on the specific beliefs in question. However, in general, rationality requires that beliefs be based on evidence that is available to anyone who takes the time to look for it. If someone believes something for which there is no objective evidence, that belief is not rational. 

There are a number of reasons why someone might hold beliefs for which there is no objective evidence. Some people believe things because they are afraid of what they might find out if they looked for evidence and found it to be against what they believe. Others believe things because they want to believe them, regardless of whether or not there is any evidence to support the belief. Still, others believe things because they have been told them, without ever being given any evidence to support the belief.

In all of these cases, the belief is not rational. Beliefs that are not based on evidence are open to question and criticism, and can easily be disproven. It is only through the process of looking for and finding evidence that we can form truly rational beliefs."
Human: Give me the list of top 100 tech categories Assistant:,"There is no definitive list of the top 100 tech categories. However, some of the most common categories include artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, cybersecurity, data analytics, virtual reality, and web development.

I am fighting Yugoloths in Gehenna. I roll to attack them with my +1 Rapier. Does a 24 hit? Assistant:","There are a few things to consider when rolling to attack Yugoloths with a +1 Rapier. First, you need to take into account the weapon's damage, which is 1d6 + 2. Second, you need to consider the Yugoloth's Armor Class (AC). The Yugoloth's AC is 15, so you need to roll a 16 or higher to hit them. Finally, you need to take into account the Yugoloth's Hit Points. The Yugoloth has 80 Hit Points, so you need to roll a 17 or higher to deal 24 damage to them.

"Human: A man has a rather old car being worth $2000. <br>He saw a secondhand car being worth $8000. He wants to keep his old car until he can buy the secondhand one.<br>He thinks he can save $1000 each month but the prices of his old <br>car and of the new one decrease of 1.5 percent per month.<br>Furthermore this percent of loss increases of `0.5` percent <br>Our man finds it difficult to make all these calculations.<br>Can you help him?<br>How many months will it take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, <br>and how much money will he have left over? Assistant:","The answer to this question varies based on the answer to a few different questions, so it's hard to give a blanket answer. However, we can break down the problem into a few different parts.

The first question is how much money our man needs to save. Let's say he needs to save $6,000. The second question is how much money our man will have left over each month. Let's say he has $500 left over each month.

The third question is how many months it will take our man to save up enough money to buy the car he wants. Let's say it takes him 12 months to save up enough money. The fourth question is how much money our man will have left over after he buys the car. Let's say he has $2,000 left over after buying the car.

So, our man will have $2,500 left over each month for the next 12 months. This means he will have saved up $7,500 by the end of 12 months. He will have also spent $8,000 on the secondhand car, so he will have $500 left over."

"Human: Rewrite this text in 500 words: ""There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.
While you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?
If the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.
“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.
“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.
“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.
“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.
“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”
“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.
“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.
“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.
“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”
Language has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.
“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.
“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.
“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”
Think too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.
In popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.
“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.
“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”
But our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.
“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.
“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.
“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”
Dr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.
“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.
“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.
“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.
“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”
Again, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.
“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.
“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.
“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.
“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.
“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.
“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”
Slang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’
“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.
“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”
Language too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.
“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.
“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.
“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.
“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”
Similarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.
“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.
“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.
“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.
“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”
The phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.
Linzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.
“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.
“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.
“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”
She launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.
From ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.
“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.
“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’
“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.
“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”
Top of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.
“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.
“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.
There’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”
How a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.
“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.
“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”
Many households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.
“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.
“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”""

"Human: can you generate a data model for a test automation tool considering organizations, users, projects, goals (under projects), tests (under goals) and executions (of test cases). Each execution has a date and a passed or failed status. Assistant:","There are a few things to consider when creating a data model for a test automation tool. The first is to identify the entities that will be in the model. In this case, the entities are organizations, users, projects, goals, tests, and executions.

The second step is to define the relationships between these entities. For example, a project may have many goals, and a goal may belong to many projects. Each goal may also have many tests, and each test may be associated with many executions.

The third step is to add attributes to each entity. For example, each organization may have a name and a description, and each user may have a login name and a password. Each project may have a name and a description, and each goal may have a name and a description. Each test may have a name and a description, and each execution may have a date and a status.

Once the entities and their attributes have been defined, the next step is to add the data types for each attribute. For example, the name attribute for an organization would be a string data type, and the name attribute for a user would be a string data type as well.

After the data types have been defined, the next step is to add the primary key for each entity. The primary key is a unique identifier for each entity. For example, the primary key for an organization would be the organization's name, and the primary key for a user would be the user's login name.

Once the primary key has been defined, the next step is to add the foreign key for each relationship. The foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another entity. For example, the foreign key for the project-to-goal relationship would be the project's name, and the foreign key for the test-to-execution relationship would be the test's name.

After the foreign key has been defined, the next step is to add the data to the model. This can be done by inserting data into the appropriate tables, or by updating the data in the existing tables."
Human: How can I calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table? Assistant:,"There is no single answer to this question, as there are many ways to calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table. Some possible methods include counting the number of unique entries, the number of unique combinations, or the number of unique permutations.

One way to count the number of unique entries on a 3x4 table is to use a simple exhaustive search. In this method, we start at the first cell and check all possible combinations of values for the other cells. We then move on to the cell to the right and check all possible combinations of values for the other two cells. We continue in this manner, checking all possible combinations of values for each cell. This method has a time complexity of O(8^n), where n is the number of columns, so it can be very slow for large tables.

Another way to count the number of unique entries on a 3x4 table is to use a hash table. In this method, we create a hash table with three keys and four values, and then add all of the entries to the table. We then remove any duplicate entries from the table. This method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of entries, so it is much faster than the exhaustive search method.

To count the number of unique combinations on a 3x4 table, we can use the binomial coefficient formula. In this method, we calculate the binomial coefficient for the number of ways to choose k entries from a set of n entries. The binomial coefficient for this problem is C(4,2) = 6. This means that there are 6 ways to choose 2 entries from a 4x4 table. We can then multiply this by the number of ways to arrange the remaining 2 entries, which is C(2,2) = 1. This gives us a total of 6 x 1 = 6 unique combinations.

To count the number of unique permutations on a 3x4 table, we can use the same binomial coefficient formula. In this method, we calculate the binomial coefficient for the number of ways to permute k entries from a set of n entries. The binomial coefficient for this problem is C(4,3) = 4. This means that there are 4 ways to choose 3 entries from a 4x4 table. We can then multiply this by the number of ways to arrange the remaining 1 entry, which is C(1,"
