Human: Can you list the top 20 films or movies between 1930 and 1940 that are in English and in the US public domain? Assistant:,"There are a number of websites that offer lists of films in the public domain in the United States. The Internet Archive is one such website. It offers a list of over 800 films that are in the public domain and can be downloaded for free. The films are listed in alphabetical order and include information on the year the film was released, the director, and the stars.

Another website that offers a list of public domain films is the Public Domain Torrents website. This website offers a list of over 1,000 films that are in the public domain and can be downloaded for free. The films are listed in alphabetical order and include information on the year the film was released, the director, and the stars.

There are a number of other websites that offer lists of public domain films, but these two websites are the most comprehensive. If you are looking for a specific film, it is best to check both websites to see if it is available."

Human: List the layers of the TCP/IP model and for each layer identify one protocol. Assistant:,"The TCP/IP model consists of four layers: the link layer, the internet layer, the transport layer, and the application layer.

The link layer is the bottom-most layer of the TCP/IP model. It is responsible for transmitting data between devices on the same network. The link layer protocol that is most commonly used is Ethernet.

The internet layer is the layer above the link layer. It is responsible for routing data between different networks. The internet layer protocol that is most commonly used is IP (Internet Protocol).

The transport layer is the layer above the internet layer. It is responsible for ensuring that data is delivered reliably and in the correct order. The transport layer protocol that is most commonly used is TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).

The application layer is the top-most layer of the TCP/IP model. It is responsible for providing services to applications. The application layer protocol that is most commonly used is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)."
"Human: Please proofread and polish the passage from an academic angle and highlight the modification:
The purpose of this research was to detect the changes of happiness, the ultimate pursuit of human being, in China, by examing happines inside Chinese brain (i.e., lay beleifs) and outside Chinese brain (i.e., natural languages). In pilot study, we recruit participants to finish a word-association questions about happiness related words (seed words), and explore lay beliefs about happiness through open-ended questions. With natural language processing (NLP), we have capture words that are most similar to the seed words and constructed a dictionary related to happiness. In study 1 to 3, we examined the frequency changes of words in happiness dictionary, semantic shift of happiness, as well as the change of various life domains’ associations with happiness (vs. unhappiness) in Google Books and China’s primary official newspaper of People’s Daily since 1950s. Frequency analysis showed the frequency of happiness related words has increased since 1950s, suggesting increasing concern about happiness. Semantic shift analysis indicated that the meaning of happiness has shifted from the macro level (e.g., collective events) to the micro level (e.g., individual experiences). Word embeddings analysis demonstrated that the relative association between various life domains and happiness (vs. unhappiness) is rising, and spiritual life is as important as material life, if not more so. These findings consistently suggest that there has been a growing trend of Chinese people focusing on happiness, and the spiritual life and “little joys” of daily life are becoming increasingly recognized as sources of happiness since 1950s.

Human: Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses? Assistant:,"There are a number of reasons why banks can't use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses. One reason is that cash is not a stable source of capital. If a bank were to use all of its cash as capital, it would have no cash left to meet its day-to-day obligations, such as making loans to customers. Another reason is that cash is not a reliable measure of a bank's financial health. A bank with a large amount of cash may still be vulnerable to losses if it has a lot of risky assets on its books."

Human: Can you tell my a story about nuclear physics like dr Seuss? Assistant:,"I'd be happy to! Here's a story about nuclear physics, in the style of Dr. Seuss:

Once upon a time, in a world so small,
There were particles called protons and neutrons, you see them all.
They lived in the nucleus of an atom,
And they were very, very important, don't you know that?

One day, a proton and a neutron decided to play,
They collided and split into pieces, oh what a fray!
They became particles called pions and muons,
And they were very, very excited, they had so much fun!

But then, something strange happened that day,
The pions and muons started to decay.
They turned into particles called electron and neutrinos,
And they flew away, oh what a commotion!

The protons and neutrons watched with great surprise,
As the pions and muons flew away with no goodbyes.
They realized that the world was full of change,
And that particles could turn into something strange.

So if you ever see a particle that's new,
Just remember, it might turn into something true.
In the world of nuclear physics, anything can happen,
And that's the most exciting thing of all, my dear!"

"Human: Can you write a short story where Hildibrand Manderville somehow gets transformed into Gandalf the Grey and he must work with The Warrior of Light and Nashu to restore his regular, most gentlemanly form.  Assistant:","Hildibrand Manderville was a man of many talents. He was a skilled blacksmith, a master of the art of war, and a true gentleman. But one day, while working on a new sword, he stumbled upon a strange, magical artifact. As soon as he touched it, he felt a strange sensation wash over him, and when it passed, he found himself transformed into a being unlike any he had ever seen. He was tall and slender, with a long white beard and piercing blue eyes. He was none other than Gandalf the Grey.

At first, Hildibrand was terrified. He had no idea how he had become Gandalf, or how to turn back. But as he looked around, he saw two figures approaching him. One was the Warrior of Light, and the other was Nashu. They had come to seek his help, as they had heard that the Grey Wizard was the only one who could help them defeat the darkness that threatened their world.

Hildibrand, as Gandalf, knew that he had to help them. He used all of his knowledge and power to aid the Warrior and Nashu on their quest. But as they journeyed deeper into the darkness, Hildibrand began to feel a strange sensation. It was as if he was being pulled back towards his true form.

Finally, as they stood victorious over the defeated darkness, Hildibrand felt the transformation take place. He was once again Hildibrand Manderville, the gentleman blacksmith. He was overjoyed to be himself again, but he knew that he would never forget his time as Gandalf the Grey. He had learned so much, and he had grown so much, that he knew he would always carry a piece of the Grey Wizard with him."

"Human: Write an interview between a Female Film director and a journalist. Use advanced english to talk about the low number of Female Film Directors in World Films. Also include many questions and answer where the director cheer up new generations to make films , where female rights can be outstanding. Assistant:","The interview is about the low number of female film directors in world films. The journalist is asking the director questions about this issue, and the director is answering with enthusiasm and passion.

Journalist: Good morning, thank you for joining us today.

Director: Good morning, thank you for having me.

Journalist: So, let's get straight to the point. There are very few female film directors in the world, why do you think that is?

Director: Well, there are a number of factors that contribute to this issue. One of the main reasons is that the film industry has traditionally been a male-dominated field. This means that there are fewer opportunities for women to break into the industry, and even fewer opportunities for them to rise to positions of power like directing.

Journalist: That makes sense. But what can be done to change this?

Director: There are a number of things that can be done. First and foremost, we need to create more opportunities for women to enter the industry. This can be done by providing more scholarships and internships for women, and by actively seeking out women to work on films.

Journalist: And once women are in the industry, how can we help them to advance?

Director: We need to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for women in the industry. This means providing mentorship and networking opportunities, and actively advocating for women to be hired for key positions on films.

Journalist: That's great. But what can be done to address the issue of female representation on screen?

Director: We need to see more diverse and complex female characters on screen. We also need to see more female actors and actresses in leading roles. This will help to challenge the stereotypes and biases that exist in our culture, and will provide more positive role models for young girls.

Journalist: Absolutely. And finally, what message do you have for young girls who are interested in becoming film directors?

Director: My message to them is to never give up on their dreams. The film industry can be tough and unforgiving, but it is also incredibly rewarding. If you are passionate about filmmaking, then go for it. Don't let anyone tell"

Human: 4 / 4Write a poem about a family sailing vacation in Bora Bora in the style of Robert Frost Assistant:,"The sun was setting over the turquoise waters of Bora Bora as the family sailed into the harbor. The sails were full of wind and the boat glided effortlessly through the calm waters. The family had been sailing for days, and the excitement was palpable. They had been planning this vacation for months, and finally, they were here.

As they approached the dock, the family could see the island rising up from the sea. The peak of Mount Pahia was shrouded in mist, and the palm trees swayed gently in the breeze. The air was filled with the sweet scent of frangipani, and the sound of the surf crashing against the shore.

The family tied up the boat and made their way to their bungalow. They had rented a small house on the beach, with a view of the lagoon and the island. The children ran ahead, eager to explore their new surroundings. The parents followed, carrying the bags and the cooler.

The bungalow was simple but comfortable, with a thatched roof and a screened-in porch. The family spent the rest of the evening exploring the island, walking along the beach and swimming in the lagoon. They saw sea turtles and stingrays, and even spotted a pod of dolphins in the distance.

As the sun set, the family gathered on the porch to watch the stars come out. They sat in comfortable chairs, sipping cocktails and talking about their adventures. The children were tired but happy, and the parents were content and relaxed.

This was the vacation they had been dreaming of for so long, and it was everything they had hoped it would be. The sailing, the snorkeling, the sunsets – it was all perfect. And as they sat there, watching the stars twinkle overhead, they knew that this was a vacation they would never forget."
Human: explain The Death of Ivan Ilych Assistant:,"The Death of Ivan Ilych, a novella by Leo Tolstoy, is a story of a man's life and death, and the impact of his life on those around him. The novella is divided into four parts, each of which explores a different aspect of Ivan Ilych's life and death.

In the first part, we are introduced to Ivan Ilych, a man who has spent his life in the service of the government. He is a successful man, with a good job and a comfortable home, but he is also a man who is deeply unhappy. He is married to a woman he does not love, and he has no friends. He is a man who is alone in the world.

In the second part, Ivan Ilych becomes ill. He is diagnosed with a terminal illness, and he knows that he will soon die. He is filled with fear and anxiety, and he is unable to come to terms with his own mortality. He is a man who is facing the end of his life, and he is unable to cope with the thought of his own death.

In the third part, Ivan Ilych's condition worsens. He is in constant pain, and he is unable to do anything to relieve his suffering. He is a man who is trapped in his own body, and he is unable to escape the pain and suffering that is consuming him.

In the fourth part, Ivan Ilych dies. His death is a peaceful one, and he is finally able to find some relief from the pain and suffering that has consumed him. But his death also has a profound impact on those around him. His wife and his friends are devastated by his loss, and they are left to pick up the pieces of their own lives.

The Death of Ivan Ilych is a powerful story about the human condition. It is a story about the fragility of life, and the inevitability of death. It is a story about the importance of living a meaningful life, and the need to find some kind of peace and happiness in the face of death."
"Human: Instaknow Inc. has developed a highly unique, patented real-time process automation platform, the Instaknow-ACE r (Active Collaboration Engine). Instaknow-ACE implements the SOA and BPM capabilities in a radically advanced manner, using ""Non-intrusive Model Driven Architecture (n-MDA)"".

"Human: Why is it that only proteins, carbohydrates and fats are deemed to have caloric value?<br>Just to clarify - consider the hypothetical situation below:<br>100g of 'carbohydrates' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'protein' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'fat' = 900kCal<br>100g of 'vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes' = ? Assistant:","There are a number of reasons why only proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are deemed to have caloric value. One reason is that these macronutrients are the primary sources of energy for the body. Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which is used by cells for energy. Proteins are broken down into amino acids, which can be used for energy or for building and repairing tissues. Fats are broken down into fatty acids, which can be used for energy or stored in the body as adipose tissue.

Another reason why only these macronutrients are deemed to have caloric value is that they are the only ones that can be metabolized to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy currency of the body. Vitamins, minerals, and other electrolytes are important for many bodily functions, but they do not provide energy in the same way that macronutrients do.

Finally, the caloric value of macronutrients is based on the amount of energy that the body needs to digest, absorb, and metabolize them. The body needs to use more energy to digest, absorb, and metabolize proteins and fats than it does to digest and absorb carbohydrates. Therefore, proteins and fats have a higher caloric value than carbohydrates."

"Human: How well does the following response respond to the prompt? ..... Prompt=  

After reading Lalor’s Chapter 8 as well as Goode’s explanation of curriculum evaluation necessity and models, explain what your school does to evaluate curriculum. Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? 

Response=  

In Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   

I would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.

Human: define a new language that contains words that are with numbers and letters such as 'IL9op' Assistant:,"A new language that contains words with numbers and letters, such as 'IL9op', could be defined as a way of combining words and numbers to create new words with specific meanings. In this language, the numbers and letters would be combined in a specific way to create new words. For example, the word 'IL9op' could be defined as a combination of the words 'in' and 'loop', with the number 9 added to the beginning to create a new word with a specific meaning.

In this language, the numbers and letters could be combined in a variety of ways to create new words with different meanings. For example, the word '3A4' could be defined as a combination of the words 'three' and 'four', with the letter 'A' added to the beginning to create a new word with a specific meaning.

This new language could be used in a variety of ways, such as in writing, speaking, or even in computer programming. It could be used to create new words that are more specific than existing words, or to create new words that are more concise. It could also be used to create new words that are more easily understood, or to create new words that are more memorable."
Human: Write me a 2000 word essay on a water safety engineering project. Assistant:,"A water safety engineering project is a multi-disciplinary approach to ensuring the safety of water systems. The project involves identifying and assessing potential hazards in water systems, and implementing measures to mitigate those hazards. The goal of a water safety engineering project is to provide safe and reliable water to the public.

There are a number of different types of hazards that can be present in water systems. Some of the most common hazards include bacterial and viral contamination, chemical contamination, and physical hazards such as pipes and valves. Each of these hazards can pose a serious risk to human health, and it is important to take steps to mitigate them.

One of the most important aspects of a water safety engineering project is the development of a water safety plan. A water safety plan is a document that outlines the steps that will be taken to ensure the safety of a water system. The plan includes information on the potential hazards present in the system, as well as the measures that will be taken to mitigate those hazards.

The development of a water safety plan is a collaborative effort between a number of different stakeholders. These stakeholders may include water utility companies, government agencies, and community groups. It is important for all stakeholders to be involved in the development of the plan, as they will all be impacted by the plan.

Once a water safety plan has been developed, it must be implemented. This may involve a number of different measures, such as the installation of new equipment, the development of new procedures, and the training of employees. It is important to ensure that all employees are aware of the hazards present in the system, and that they know how to mitigate those hazards.

In addition to the development and implementation of a water safety plan, there are a number of other measures that can be taken to ensure the safety of water systems. One of the most important of these measures is the regular testing of water for contaminants. This testing can help to identify any potential hazards that may be present in the water, and allow for the implementation of measures to mitigate those hazards.

Another important measure is the regular maintenance of water infrastructure. This includes the inspection and repair of pipes and valves, as well as the replacement of any"

Cost Structure (1.5 points)
Revenue Streams (1.5 points)

- Startup cost: say we are starting at FireFly Burger restaurant, we have 7 branches all over Jordan, we will install two monitors of 15.6” in each branch as a start, this will cost us $250 per screen, 250*2*7= $3500. System development cost will be $0 since we all have programming background, especially in the needed language (C#). Our database is cloud-based and free for 20k operations/day, it will be increased if needed, $0.05/10k operations. 

- Fixed cost: it’s a one-time installation, and software will be updated automatically. 

- Variable costs: we will not have free installation for the kiosk, and having a well-implemented system will do the advertising job for us since we chose a busy place. But for the first couple of months we will have an employee in each branch explaining to people how to use the system so these employees will get paid around $400/month. (or we could pay extra for an employee who is already working in the restaurant to explain to people).

Total: 3500+2*400*7  = $9100 



-The percentage taken from each purchase (food order) of the KIOSK device that is in the possession of the restaurants purchasing the device (this is variable). Selling each unit for $400, our revenue will be $150/screen.

Human: How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge Assistant:,"There are a number of ways to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge. One way is to use a dataset that has been labeled with instance segmentation, so that the model can learn to predict the instance segmentation directly. Another way is to use a dataset that has been labeled with object class and bounding box, and to use the object class and bounding box information to help guide the instance segmentation.

Another way to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge is to use a technique called ""mask R-CNN"". Mask R-CNN is a type of object detection algorithm that uses a separate branch to predict a mask for each object in the image. The mask is used to segment the object from the background, and the instance segmentation AP metric can be used to evaluate the quality of the mask.

Finally, human knowledge can be used to improve instance segmentation AP metrics by manually correcting the predictions of the model. This can be done by manually drawing bounding boxes around the objects in the image, and then using the bounding box information to correct the predictions of the model. This can help to improve the accuracy of the instance segmentation, and can also help to improve the AP metric."
Human: what is needed for self-sufficient living spaces Assistant:,"There are a number of things that are needed for self-sufficient living spaces. Some of the most important items include:

1. Renewable energy sources: In order to be self-sufficient, it is important to have a reliable source of renewable energy. This could be solar panels, wind turbines, or hydroelectric power.

2. Water collection and storage: It is important to have a way to collect and store rainwater or other forms of water for use in the home. This could be through a rainwater harvesting system or a well.

3. Food production: In order to be self-sufficient, it is important to have a way to produce food on site. This could be through a garden, orchard, or livestock.

4. Waste management: It is important to have a plan for managing waste on site. This could include composting, recycling, and disposal of non-recyclable materials.

5. Building materials: In order to build a self-sufficient living space, it is important to use sustainable and locally sourced building materials."
"Human: proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.
However, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.
As a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.
From the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.
All in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.
During my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.
My self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.
In short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.
These difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.
Kevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.
Human self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.
This suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.
The relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.
In my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.
Also, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?
These reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.
My creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.
My artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.
From a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.
I have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.
Often times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.
While a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.
Therefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.
In the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.
Therefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression
In short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.
Among my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.
In the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.
I experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.
In the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.
I found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.
I was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay ""Glitch Feminism,"" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of ""destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse"" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.
I tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.
In this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.
I believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.
In addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.
I began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.
Balloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.
I create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.

For me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.
My work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.
In conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works. Assistant:","

Human: Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking Assistant:,"Inconsistency and ideological thinking are closely related. Ideological thinking is a way of thinking that is based on a set of beliefs or ideas that are not open to question or debate. It is a way of thinking that is often used to justify one's own beliefs or actions, and to criticize the beliefs or actions of others.

One of the main problems with ideological thinking is that it can lead to inconsistency. When people are wedded to a particular ideology, they may be unwilling to consider alternative perspectives or evidence that contradicts their beliefs. This can lead to a kind of intellectual closure, where people are not open to new ideas or perspectives.

Inconsistency can also arise when people are trying to justify their own beliefs or actions. If someone's beliefs or actions are not consistent with each other, or if they are not consistent with the evidence, then they may be forced to rely on ideological thinking to justify them. For example, someone who is opposed to abortion may also be opposed to birth control, even though these two positions are not logically consistent.

Ideological thinking can also lead to a kind of ""motivated reasoning,"" where people are more likely to accept or reject evidence based on whether it supports their pre-existing beliefs. This can lead to a kind of ""confirmation bias,"" where people are more likely to accept evidence that confirms their beliefs, and to reject evidence that contradicts them.

Overall, inconsistency and ideological thinking are closely related, and can lead to a kind of intellectual closure that is not open to new ideas or perspectives. It is important to be aware of these tendencies, and to make an effort to be open-minded and to consider alternative perspectives."
Human: Why do people give Reddit Gold to admins? Assistant:,"There are a number of reasons why people give Reddit Gold to admins. One reason is to show appreciation for the admin's work on the subreddit. Admins put a lot of time and effort into moderating the subreddit and creating content, and Reddit Gold is a way for users to show their appreciation. Another reason why people give Reddit Gold to admins is to gain favor or to try to influence the admin's decisions. For example, if a user wants the admin to promote their post or to give them a higher karma score, they may give the admin some Reddit Gold in the hopes that the admin will be more likely to help them out."

Human: What does Nassim Nicholas Taleb say about market efficiency? Assistant:,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a renowned author and former trader, has expressed skepticism about market efficiency. In his book ""The Black Swan,"" Taleb argues that the traditional assumption of market efficiency is flawed because it fails to account for rare, unpredictable events (known as ""black swans"") that can have a significant impact on the market.

Taleb contends that the market is not always efficient, and that prices can deviate significantly from their true value. He argues that investors who rely solely on historical data to make investment decisions are likely to be disappointed, as past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.

Instead of relying on market efficiency, Taleb advocates for a more nuanced approach to investing. He suggests that investors should focus on protecting themselves against potential losses, rather than trying to maximize gains.

"Human: 6Rephrase this article into a third person and conversational and very unique 2000 words article include a headings about  Based on our investigation so far, Reddit user passwords and accounts are safe, but on Sunday night (pacific time), Reddit systems were hacked as a result of a sophisticated and highly-targeted phishing attack. They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.

What Happened?
On late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.

After successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).

Exposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.

How Did We Respond?
Soon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.

Our goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.

User Account Protection
Since we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.

Also: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!

Human: antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called Assistant:,"The answer to this question varies based on context, as the best antenna for a particular application depends on a variety of factors. However, some tips on how to choose the best antenna for a particular application include considering the frequency range of the antenna, the gain of the antenna, and the directivity of the antenna. The frequency range of the antenna should be compatible with the frequency range of the device it will be used with. The gain of the antenna should be high enough to provide the desired range and directivity of the antenna. The directivity of the antenna should be such that it provides a high gain in the direction of the desired signal and a low gain in all other directions."

"Human: Hi, I have a question about MFCC (mel frequency cepstral coefficients). Are they the same thing as a MEL-spectogram, or is there a difference? Assistant:","The Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and the Mel-spectrogram are both representations of audio signals that are used in audio signal processing and analysis. However, there is a difference between the two.

The Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) is a representation of an audio signal that is derived from the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of the signal. The STFT is a way of breaking down the audio signal into its component frequencies over time. The MFCC is then derived from the STFT by taking the logarithm of the power spectrum, multiplying it by a set of Mel filters, and then taking the discrete cosine transform (DCT) of the resulting vector. The Mel filters are a set of triangular filters that are spaced on the Mel scale, which is a nonlinear frequency scale that is based on the way the human ear perceives different frequencies. The MFCC is a way of representing the audio signal in a way that is more similar to the way the human ear hears it.

The Mel-spectrogram, on the other hand, is a representation of an audio signal that is derived from the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of the signal, but it does not take the logarithm of the power spectrum. Instead, it takes the absolute value of the power spectrum and then multiplies it by a set of Mel filters. The resulting vector is then taken to be the Mel-spectrogram of the signal. The Mel-spectrogram is a way of representing the audio signal in a way that is more similar to the way the human ear hears it, but it is not as detailed as the MFCC.

In summary, the MFCC is a more detailed representation of the audio signal than the Mel-spectrogram, but it is also more computationally expensive to compute. The Mel-spectrogram is a simpler representation of the audio signal that is less computationally expensive, but it is not as detailed as the MFCC."

"Human: 2 / 2Create a 2000 words article conversational article and Rephrase this with 100% no plagiarism and unique For the past month or so, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has received much attention within the tech community. ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.

Microsoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).
Microsoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.

Of course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.

This includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.

Microsoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023
During the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.

“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.

Microsoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.

The chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.

Windows 12 AI camera feature
Portrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI
Panos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.

“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.

Major versions of Windows to ship every three years
Microsoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.

Windows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.

After 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).

We should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.

Microsoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.

There’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.

But keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.


And so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.


Just consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.

“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”

(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)

What might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.

Ten billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!

It’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.

Windows AI chips
Microsoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.

Parts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.

Theoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.

What can we expect from AI in Windows?
Panay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.

That’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.

But it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.

For Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.

The other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.

Microsoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”

Back then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.

How bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, ""I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine."" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, ""Even a piece of junk will qualify"" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, ""We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.""

I’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.

"Human: Mill vs Gartner
This case is about a dispute over the right to dig clay on a piece of land. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a ""parol license,"" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.

Smith vs Mill Company
The case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.

Gartner vs Baker
The case of ""Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell"" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.

The backstory should be dark and mysterious in tone but without the usual cliches like ""raiders attacked the village"". Make it unique and interesting. Be creative. Assistant:","The backstory of my half-elf ranger character is a dark and mysterious one, filled with secrets and twists. Born to a human mother and an elven father in a small village on the edge of a vast and dangerous forest, my character's early life was marked by tragedy. When my character was just a baby, my father was killed in a bizarre accident involving a magical artifact, and my mother was left alone to raise me.

As I grew older, I became increasingly fascinated with the forest that loomed just beyond our village. I spent hours exploring its depths, learning the secrets of the plants and animals that lived there. But despite my love for the forest, my mother was terrified of it, and she did everything in her power to keep me away from it.

One day, when I was just a teenager, my mother disappeared into the forest, leaving me alone and unprotected. I searched for her for days, but she was nowhere to be found. Eventually, I was forced to give up my search and return to the village, where I was taken in by the villagers.

But even as I tried to make a new life for myself in the village, I couldn't shake the feeling that my mother was still out there, somewhere in the forest. And so, I began to explore the forest again, determined to find out what had happened to her.

As I delved deeper into the forest, I began to uncover clues that suggested my mother had been involved in something dark and sinister. She had been studying the forbidden magic of the forest, and had become obsessed with the power it held. Eventually, she had disappeared into the heart of the forest to search for a powerful artifact that would give her the power to control the forest.

I knew that I had to find my mother and stop her from unleashing the power of the forest on the world. But as I searched for her, I began to realize that the forest was not what it seemed. It was alive, and it was watching me. And it would stop at nothing to keep me from uncovering its secrets."

"Human: In this math problem, we are asked to figure out the percentage of total profits that are made in each quarter. They are 90% in the first quarter, 92% in the second quarter, 81% in the third quarter and 88% in the fourth quarter. What is the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters? Assistant:","There are four quarters in a year. To find the total profit percentage over a period of time, we need to find the average of the profit percentages for each quarter.

The first quarter has a profit percentage of 90%, so the total profit for that quarter is 90% of the total revenue. The second quarter has a profit percentage of 92%, so the total profit for that quarter is 92% of the total revenue. The third quarter has a profit percentage of 81%, so the total profit for that quarter is 81% of the total revenue. The fourth quarter has a profit percentage of 88%, so the total profit for that quarter is 88% of the total revenue.

To find the average profit percentage, we add up all of the profit percentages and divide by the number of quarters. In this case, the total profit percentage is (90 + 92 + 81 + 88) / 4 = 351 / 4 = 87.5%.

Therefore, the total profit percentage over a period of time, based upon these quarters, is 87.5%."
Human: Why is it a bad idea to give a mouse a cookie? Assistant:,"On the surface, it might seem like a kind and harmless gesture to give a mouse a cookie. After all, who doesn't love a good cookie? However, there are a few reasons why it's not a good idea to give a mouse a cookie.

First of all, mice are notorious for their love of sweets, and a cookie is just the kind of treat that will send them into a frenzy. They'll be so focused on getting their paws on more cookies that they'll forget all about their mouse duties, like scurrying around and squeaking.

Secondly, mice are very messy eaters, and they'll probably end up dribbling crumbs and chocolate chips all over the place. This will make a big mess, and you'll be left with the task of cleaning it up.

Finally, mice are very small, and they can easily get stuck in tight spaces. If they eat too many cookies, they might become too big to fit through the holes in their little mouse houses, and they'll be stuck. This could be very traumatic for the mouse, and it's just not worth the risk.

So, while it might seem like a kind gesture to give a mouse a cookie, it's really not a good idea. Instead, you should just let the mouse scurry around and do its thing. It's much better for everyone that way."
Human: which second messenger molecule acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions Assistant:,"The second messenger molecule that acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions is inositol triphosphate (IP3). When IP3 is formed, it binds to receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, causing the release of calcium ions from the ER lumen into the cytosol. This increase in cytosolic calcium ions can then trigger a variety of cellular responses, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression."
Human: How can anti-deressants make people think or act suicidally? Suicidal thoughts or actions' are a side effect of every single anti-depressant I've seen. Is the medicine controlling your mind or something? Assistant:,"Anti-depressants are a type of medication that can help alleviate symptoms of depression. However, they can also have a number of side effects, including suicidal thoughts or actions. It is important to be aware of these side effects and to seek medical help if they occur.

There are a number of ways in which anti-depressants can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or actions. One way is by altering the levels of certain chemicals in the brain. Anti-depressants can increase the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is involved in mood regulation. However, this can also increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or actions.

Another way in which anti-depressants can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or actions is by disrupting sleep patterns. Anti-depressants can interfere with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to insomnia or other sleep disorders. This can lead to feelings of fatigue, hopelessness, and despair, which can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or actions.

Finally, anti-depressants can also affect a person's mood and behavior. They can cause a person to feel more anxious, agitated, or irritable, which can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or actions.

It is important to be aware of these side effects and to seek medical help if they occur. If you are taking anti-depressants and are experiencing suicidal thoughts or actions, it is important to talk to your doctor. They can help you to manage these side effects and ensure that you are safe."

Human: Draft a ministerial speech outlining the top five benefits that innovation brings to the Australian economy Assistant:,"There are a number of factors that contribute to a country's economic success. However, innovation is one of the most important. Innovation drives economic growth, creates new industries and jobs, and improves the quality of life for citizens. In this speech, I will outline the top five benefits that innovation brings to the Australian economy.

First, innovation drives economic growth. By creating new products, services, and processes, innovation helps to increase productivity and competitiveness. This, in turn, leads to increased economic output and growth. In fact, studies have shown that innovation is one of the key drivers of economic growth in Australia.

Second, innovation creates new industries and jobs. When new products and services are developed, new industries are created. And when new industries are created, new jobs are created. Innovation has been responsible for the creation of many new industries in Australia, including the tech industry, the biotech industry, and the renewable energy industry.

Third, innovation improves the quality of life for citizens. Innovation has led to the development of new technologies and products that improve our health, our safety, and our quality of life. For example, innovations in medical technology have led to better health outcomes for Australians. Innovations in transport technology have made our roads safer. And innovations in communication technology have made it easier for us to stay connected with each other.

Fourth, innovation helps to solve some of the biggest challenges facing our society. Innovation has the potential to solve some of the biggest challenges facing our society, including climate change, energy security, and healthcare. For example, innovations in renewable energy are helping to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of climate change. Innovations in healthcare are helping to improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

Finally, innovation is a key driver of international competitiveness. In today's global economy, it is no longer enough for countries to simply produce high-quality goods and services. They must also be innovative and adaptable in order to stay ahead of the competition. Innovation has helped to make Australia a more competitive country on the world stage, and it will continue to do so in the future."

Human: Is online casino legal in India? Assistant:,"The legality of online casinos in India is a complex question, as the country's gambling laws are not well-defined. The Public Gambling Act of 1867 makes it illegal to run a gambling establishment in any state of India, but it does not specifically address online gambling.

Some states in India, such as Goa and Sikkim, have specific laws that allow for online gambling. In these states, online casinos are legal and regulated by the state government. However, in other states, online gambling is illegal and can lead to serious consequences, including fines and imprisonment.

It is important to note that the Indian government has proposed new legislation that would specifically address online gambling. The bill, known as the ""The Bill on Regulation of Online Gaming and Fantasy Sports (ROGFS) Bill, 2018,"" would regulate online gambling and fantasy sports in India. However, the bill has not yet been passed into law.

In summary, the legality of online casinos in India is a complex issue, and it is important to be aware of the specific laws in the state you are in. If you are unsure about the legality of online gambling in your state, it is best to consult with a legal professional."
Human: Write a section for an award application detailing how photography has insipired you Assistant:,"Photography has inspired me in a number of ways. First, it has given me a new perspective on the world. Through the lens of a camera, I have learned to see the beauty in even the most mundane things. A photograph can capture a moment in time and preserve it forever, allowing me to look back and remember the details of a particular moment.

Second, photography has taught me about the importance of lighting. Lighting can make or break a photograph, and learning how to use light to create the desired effect has been a valuable skill. I have learned to pay attention to the light and to use it to my advantage, whether I am taking a portrait or a landscape photograph.

Third, photography has taught me about patience. Taking a good photograph requires patience, as you need to wait for the right moment to snap the shot. This has taught me to slow down and to be more mindful of my surroundings. I have learned to take my time and to enjoy the moment, rather than rushing through it.

Finally, photography has given me a creative outlet. I enjoy experimenting with different techniques and styles, and I find that photography allows me to express myself in a way that I cannot with words. It has also given me the opportunity to connect with other photographers and to learn from them, which has been a valuable experience."
"Human: I want to eventually become a plant/manufacturing/production manager, and eventually a Chief Operating Officer. What sort of experience and post-graduate education path would you recommend? Please provide non-obvious and atypical career paths leading to such positions, on top of the classic ones. Assistant:","There are a number of different paths that can lead to becoming a plant/manufacturing/production manager, and eventually a Chief Operating Officer. Some of the most common include starting out as an entry-level employee and working your way up through the ranks, earning a degree in a field related to manufacturing or business, and gaining experience in other areas of the company such as finance or human resources.

One non-obvious career path that can lead to becoming a plant/manufacturing/production manager is starting out in a different field altogether, such as engineering or computer science. Many companies are now using advanced technology and automation in their manufacturing processes, so having a background in these areas can be very useful. Additionally, if you have a background in engineering or computer science, you may be able to move into a management position more quickly than someone who only has experience in manufacturing.

Another atypical career path that can lead to becoming a plant/manufacturing/production manager is starting out in a different industry altogether. For example, someone who has experience in the service industry or in retail may have skills that are transferable to a manufacturing environment. Additionally, someone who has experience in a related field such as logistics or procurement may also have an advantage when it comes to moving into a manufacturing management position."
Human: explain the basics of area and perimeter Assistant:,"The area of a shape is the amount of space inside the shape. The perimeter of a shape is the distance around the shape.

The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length x Width

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = Length + Length + Width + Width

The area of a triangle is half the base times the height:

Area = (Base x Height) / 2

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides:

Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3

The area of a circle is equal to pi (π) times the radius squared:

Area = π x Radius^2

The perimeter of a circle is equal to 2 times the radius times pi (π):

Perimeter = 2 x Radius x π"

Human: Write a story about Anakin Skywalker encountering a Jedi who speaks and acts like a 1920s British aristocrat Assistant:,"

Anakin Skywalker was on a mission to the planet of Tatooine, to investigate a report of a Separatist threat. As he landed his ship in the spaceport, he noticed a figure standing off to the side, dressed in a long, flowing robe, with a cane in hand. The figure turned to face him, and Anakin was taken aback. The Jedi was dressed in the traditional Jedi robes, but he spoke and acted like a 1920s British aristocrat.

""Ah, young Skywalker,"" the Jedi said, in a posh accent. ""I say, what brings you to this forsaken planet?""

Anakin was taken aback by the Jedi's mannerisms, but he quickly composed himself. ""I'm here to investigate a Separatist threat,"" he replied.

The Jedi nodded, and began to walk towards the spaceport. ""Ah, yes. The Separatists. Such a nuisance. But, I suppose, one mustn't be too hasty in one's judgments. After all, one never knows what one might find, if one looks closely enough.""

Anakin followed the Jedi, trying to make sense of his strange behavior. As they walked, the Jedi began to speak about the importance of etiquette, and the proper way to hold a lightsaber.

""You see, young Skywalker,"" the Jedi said, ""a true Jedi must always be mindful of his manners. One must always be polite, and courteous. And, of course, one must always hold one's lightsaber correctly. It's simply not done to hold it like a common thug.""

Anakin was beginning to get frustrated with the Jedi's strange behavior, but he tried to keep his cool. ""I understand,"" he said. ""But, I think I've seen enough. I'll just go and investigate the Separatist threat on my own.""

The Jedi nodded, and tipped his hat. ""Ah, very well, young Skywalker. But, do be careful. One never knows what one might find, on a planet like this."""

The name ""cuban link"" is thought to have originated from the fact that the chain was popular among Cuban immigrants to the United States in the early 20th century. Today, the cuban link chain is a popular choice for men's jewelry, particularly for chains and bracelets. It is also sometimes used for women's jewelry, particularly for bold and edgy styles."
"Human: cost of fuel for a 14 mile journey in a car with 48mpg, fuel costs 625 pence per gallon and there is heavy traffic for half the journey Assistant:","A car with a fuel consumption of 48 miles per gallon will use 0.35 gallons of fuel to travel 14 miles. The cost of this fuel can be calculated by multiplying the quantity of fuel used by the cost of one gallon of fuel. The cost of one gallon of fuel is 625 pence, so the cost of 0.35 gallons of fuel is:

0.35 gallons x 625 pence/gallon = 218.75 pence

Please write in instructive writing style. Assistant:","

Derivative protocols and products in decentralized finance (DeFi) have revolutionized the financial industry by providing a secure, transparent, and open platform for trading derivatives. In this article, we will explore the different types of derivative protocols and products available in DeFi, their benefits, and the risks associated with them.

First, let's start with the basics. A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its value from an underlying asset. In DeFi, the most common underlying assets are cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Derivatives can be traded on centralized exchanges, but they can also be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) using smart contracts.

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. They allow for the automation of the derivative trading process, making it faster, cheaper, and more secure. Smart contracts also allow for the creation of a wide variety of derivative products, such as futures, options, and swaps.

Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on a specific date. Options contracts give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on a specific date. Swaps are agreements to exchange a series of cash flows over a period of time.

There are several derivative protocols and products available in DeFi. The most common are dYdX, Synthetix, and CloseCross.

dYdX is a decentralized derivatives exchange that offers spot, margin, and perpetuals trading. dYdX combines non-custodial, on-chain settlement with an off-chain low-latency matching engine with order books. This allows for fast and secure trading without the need for intermediaries.

Synthetix is a derivatives issuance protocol that enables the decentralized creation and trading of derivatives on assets such as stocks, currencies, and commodities. This allows for the creation of a wide variety of derivative products, such as futures, options, and swaps.

CloseCross is a decentralized, multi-party derivatives trading platform. It"
"Human: How does money go from my pocket, through the stock market, and to support the business I've bought stock from? Assistant:","The stock market is a platform where businesses can raise money by selling a portion of ownership (stocks) to investors. When you buy stocks, you are essentially buying a small piece of that company. The money you pay for the stocks goes to the company, which can then use that money to fund its operations, expand its business, or pay off debts.

When you sell your stocks, you can make a profit if the value of the stock has gone up since you bought it. The profit you make is the difference between what you paid for the stock and what you sold it for.

The stock market is a way for businesses to raise money, and for investors to make money by buying and selling stocks."

However, some general suggestions can be made.

The patient's diabetes and CKD are well-controlled, and the current medications seem appropriate. However, the patient's high blood pressure and constipation should be monitored and managed appropriately.

The patient's itchy skin and constipation may be related to their diabetes and CKD. The patient should be advised to drink plenty of water, eat a high-fiber diet, and exercise regularly to help manage these symptoms.

The patient's kidney function is declining, and dialysis may be necessary in the future. However, the patient's current medications seem appropriate, and there is no need to switch to insulin at this time.

The patient should be monitored regularly by a nephrologist and an endocrinologist to assess their kidney function and diabetes control. The patient's medications may need to be adjusted as their condition changes."
Human: What if people only valued and took pride in the things that were true about themselves? Assistant:,"This question is nonsensical because it is impossible for people to only value and take pride in the things that are true about themselves. People are complex beings with many different qualities, traits, and characteristics, and it is not possible for them to only value and take pride in the things that are true about themselves.

Additionally, the concept of ""true"" is subjective and can vary from person to person. What one person considers to be true about themselves may not be the same for another person. Therefore, it is not possible for people to only value and take pride in the things that are true about themselves.

Furthermore, it is important to remember that people are not defined by a single trait or characteristic. They are complex beings with many different qualities, traits, and characteristics, and it is not possible for them to only value and take pride in one aspect of themselves."

Human: Explain me the Finite Elemente Method Assistant:,"The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe a wide range of physical phenomena, such as heat transfer, fluid flow, and structural mechanics. The FEM is a powerful tool for solving these types of problems, and it is widely used in a variety of fields, including engineering, physics, and finance.

The basic idea behind the FEM is to divide the problem domain into smaller subdomains, called finite elements. Each finite element is a small, simple shape that can be solved separately. The solutions of the individual finite elements are then combined to obtain the solution of the entire problem domain.

There are several key steps involved in the FEM:

1. Divide the problem domain into finite elements.
2. Define the boundary conditions for the problem.
3. Assign the material properties for each finite element.
4. Solve the equations for each finite element.
5. Combine the solutions of the individual finite elements to obtain the solution of the entire problem domain.

The FEM is a very powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems. It is particularly useful for problems that involve complex geometries, nonlinear material properties, and/or boundary conditions. The FEM is also very flexible, and it can be used to solve a wide range of different types of problems."

"Human: Title: ""Inspiration, Infallibility, and Inerrancy: Hath God Said? with R.C. Sproul - YouTube""
Video Transcript: ""SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.""
Video Summary: Assistant:","
Dr. R.C. Sproul defines the term inerrancy and its significance in theology. He explains that the word inerrancy is not a part of the Bible, but it is a word that has been coined to describe the belief that the Bible is without error. He also discusses the difference between inerrancy and infallibility, and how the term inerrancy has been used to describe the Bible's lack of error. He also talks about how the concept of inerrancy has been associated with the Roman Catholic Church's doctrine of infallibility."
Human: Introduce the ”financial markets and institutions“ by Frederic S. Mishkin Assistant:,"The financial markets and institutions are a crucial part of any economy. They provide a platform for companies to raise capital, investors to make informed investment decisions, and facilitate the flow of funds between savers and borrowers. In this blog post, we will explore the key concepts covered in Frederic S. Mishra’s book “Financial Markets and Institutions.”

The book is divided into three parts. The first part covers the basic concepts of financial markets and institutions, including the different types of markets, the players involved, and the various instruments traded. The second part explores the functioning of specific financial markets, such as the stock market, bond market, and derivatives market. The third part discusses the role of financial institutions, such as commercial banks, investment banks, and central banks.

One of the key takeaways from the book is the importance of financial markets and institutions in facilitating economic growth and development. They provide a platform for companies to access capital, investors to make informed investment decisions, and facilitate the flow of funds between savers and borrowers.

Another important concept covered in the book is the risk associated with financial investments. Investors must be aware of the risks involved in different types of investments and make informed decisions based on their risk tolerance.

The book also covers the role of government in regulating financial markets and institutions. Governments must strike a balance between ensuring stability in the financial system and allowing for innovation and growth.

In conclusion, “Financial Markets and Institutions” by Frederic S. Mishra is an excellent resource for anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of the financial system. The book covers a wide range of topics, from the basics of financial markets and institutions to the role of government regulation. It is a must-read for investors, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding how the financial system works."
Human: when are hops added to the brewing process? Assistant:,"Hops are added to the brewing process at various stages to contribute different characteristics to the beer. The most common addition points are during the boil, during fermentation, and during conditioning.

During the boil, hops are added to the kettle to contribute bitterness, flavor, and aroma to the beer. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they will contribute. Hops added during the boil are typically high-alpha acid hops, which provide a strong bittering effect.

During fermentation, hops can be added to the fermenter to contribute flavor and aroma. These hops are typically low-alpha acid hops, which provide a more subtle flavor and aroma.

During conditioning, hops can be added to the beer to contribute aroma and flavor. These hops are typically high-alpha acid hops, which provide a strong bittering effect.

The timing of hop additions can vary depending on the style of beer being brewed. For example, hoppy beers like IPAs and pale ales typically have multiple hop additions during the boil and during fermentation, while more malt-forward beers like porters and stouts may have only one or two hop additions during the boil."
Human: Can a Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 hypothetically lift Mount everest Assistant:,"It's hard to say for sure, but it's unlikely that a Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 could lift Mount Everest. The crane's maximum lifting capacity is 1,200 tons, and Mount Everest has a mass of around 4.6 million kilograms (10.1 million pounds). Even if we assume that the crane could somehow lift the entire mountain, it would require an enormous amount of energy to do so. The crane's boom would also need to be incredibly long to reach the top of the mountain."

Everyone seemed to know each other, and they all waved and said hello when they passed each other on the street.  I liked this about Flagstaff.  It was a very peaceful and relaxed place to live.

One of my favorite things to do in Flagstaff was to go hiking in the nearby forests.  There were so many trails to choose from, and they all led to beautiful places.  I especially liked the trail to the top of Humphreys Peak.  It was a difficult hike, but the view from the top was worth it.  You could see for miles and miles.

Another thing I liked about Flagstaff was the food.  There were so many great places to eat.  My favorite was a little cafe called the ""Mothership.""  They had the best breakfast burritos I have ever tasted.  I went there almost every morning.

Now, I will talk about my experiences living in Kaneohe, Hawaii.  Kaneohe is a small town on the island of Oahu.  It is surrounded by mountains and the ocean.  The weather in Kaneohe is warm all year round.  When I lived there, I noticed that the people were very friendly and welcoming, just like in Flagstaff.  Everyone seemed to know each other, and they all waved and said hello when they passed each other on the street.  I liked this about Kaneohe.  It was a very peaceful and relaxed place to live.

One of my favorite things to do in Kaneohe was to go to the beach.  There were"
Human: ideas for building a waitlist for a new product or service Assistant:,"There exist several avenues that can be used to build a waitlist for a new product or service. Some of these avenues include creating a landing page for the product or service, using social media to promote the waitlist, and offering incentives to people who sign up for the waitlist.

Creating a landing page for the product or service is a great way to build a waitlist. The landing page should include information about the product or service, as well as a form that people can use to sign up for the waitlist. It is important to make sure that the landing page is easy to find and that it is visually appealing.

Using social media to promote the waitlist is another good way to build a waitlist. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram can be used to post updates about the product or service and to encourage people to sign up for the waitlist. It is important to make sure that the posts are engaging and that they include a link to the landing page.

Offering incentives to people who sign up for the waitlist is a great way to encourage people to sign up. The incentives could be something like a discount on the product or service, or a free gift. It is important to make sure that the incentives are something that will be appealing to the target audience."
Human: assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual Assistant:,"There are a number of things you can do to be less reactive and use a pause ritual. The first is to recognize when you are feeling reactive. This can be difficult, as reactivity often manifests as a feeling of being ""on edge"" or ""keyed up"" rather than as a specific emotion. However, if you are aware of your own reactive tendencies, you can begin to recognize when you are feeling reactive.

Once you have recognized that you are feeling reactive, the next step is to pause. This can be difficult, as our instinct is often to react immediately to whatever is triggering our reactivity. However, if you can pause for just a moment, you can begin to regain control of your emotions and your behavior.

The next step is to use a pause ritual. A pause ritual is a specific action or activity that you perform when you feel yourself becoming reactive. The purpose of a pause ritual is to help you calm down and regain control of your emotions. There are many different types of pause rituals that you can use, and you may need to experiment to find the one that works best for you. Some common pause rituals include taking a few deep breaths, going for a walk, or doing a quick meditation.

The final step is to reflect on what triggered your reactivity. Once you have calmed down, take a moment to think about what triggered your reactivity. Was it something specific that someone said or did? Was it a particular situation or environment? Once you have identified the trigger, you can begin to work on addressing the underlying issue. This may involve talking to the person who triggered your reactivity, or it may involve making changes to your environment or your own behavior."
Human: write a 5 verse song in the style of Talking Heads based on the life of a teenager in the 1980s britain Assistant:,"

The 1980s were a time of great change, and for teenagers in Britain, it was a time of self-discovery and rebellion. In this song, we'll explore the life of a typical teenager in 1980s Britain, from the music they listened to, to the clothes they wore, to the struggles they faced.

Verse 1:
I'm a teenager in the 80s,
I'm living in a world that's all about the noise,
I've got my hair cut short and my ears pierced,
I'm wearing my ripped jeans and my band t-shirt.

Chorus:
I'm a teenager in the 80s,
I'm living life on my own terms,
I'm dancing to the beat of my own drum,
I'm a teenager in the 80s, and I'm feeling alive.

Verse 2:
I'm listening to the Smiths and the Cure,
I'm reading NME and Melody Maker,
I'm hanging out with my mates at the local youth club,
We're drinking cider and smoking fags, and we're having a blast.

Chorus:
I'm a teenager in the 80s,
I'm living life on my own terms,
I'm dancing to the beat of my own drum,
I'm a teenager in the 80s, and I'm feeling alive.

Verse 3:
But life isn't all fun and games,
There's pressure to conform and to fit in,
There's bullies at school and there's parents at home,
Who don't understand me and my rebellious skin.

Chorus:
I'm a teenager in the 80s,
I'm living life on my own terms,
I'm dancing to the beat of my own drum,
I'm a teenager in the 80s, and I'm feeling alive.

Verse 4:
But I don't care, I'm gonna be"

There are several ways to get backlinks. One way is to create high-quality content that other websites will want to link to. Another way is to create a website that is useful and valuable, and other websites will want to link to it. You can also ask other websites to link to you, or you can pay for backlinks. However, it is important to be careful when paying for backlinks, as some methods can be considered spammy and can harm your website's SEO."

First, they allow you to target a specific audience that is more likely to be interested in your products or services. Second, they can help you stand out from the competition by giving you a unique angle to market from. Finally, sub-niches can be less competitive than the overall niche, making it easier to rank well in the search engines."

We want to be funny and make users enticed to click on the push notification and potentially buy our products. Make the messages seem somewhat conversational but short. Make them funny and have puns, I should laugh while reading them. Assistant:",Hello! I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.
"Human: In order to launch a token for a Defi project, I want to sell some tokens privately to early investors and then add it to a launchpad. let me know what can I do with my smart contract? Should I create a presale contract separate from main contract? Assistant:","There is no one answer that fits all scenarios for this question, as the solution will vary depending on the specific needs of the project. However, some things to consider when deciding whether to create a separate presale contract or to include presale functionality in the main contract include the following:

1. Separation of concerns: If the presale and main sale have different logic or requirements, it may be better to keep them in separate contracts. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.
2. Reusability: If the presale contract is only used for one project, it may not be worth creating a separate contract for it. However, if the presale contract can be reused for multiple projects, it may be better to keep it separate.
3. Complexity: If the presale contract is relatively simple, it may be better to include it in the main contract. However, if the presale contract is complex or has many different logic paths, it may be better to keep it separate.
4. Security: If the presale contract is handling a lot of funds, it may be better to keep it separate from the main contract in case of a security breach.
5. Scalability: If the project is expecting a large number of users, it may be better to keep the presale and main contract separate to improve scalability."
Human: what is the recommended pattern for creating games in godot Assistant:,"The recommended pattern for creating games in Godot is to create a scene, add nodes to the scene, and then add logic to the nodes.

A scene in Godot is a container for all the nodes in your game. Nodes are objects that represent game objects, such as sprites, boxes, and buttons. You can add nodes to a scene by dragging and dropping them from the node panel on the left side of the Godot editor.

Once you have added nodes to a scene, you can add logic to them using scripts. Scripts are pieces of code that you can attach to nodes to make them do things. For example, you can attach a script to a sprite to make it move or change color.

There are many different types of nodes that you can use in Godot, including sprites, boxes, buttons, and text. Each type of node has its own set of properties and methods that you can use to customize it and make it do different things.

One of the most powerful features of Godot is its node-based scene structure. This structure allows you to create complex games with many different objects and interactions. It also makes it easy to organize and manage your game code.

To create a game in Godot, you will need to do the following:

1. Create a new project in Godot.

2. Create a scene for your game.

3. Add nodes to the scene.

4. Add logic to the nodes using scripts.

5. Test and refine your game."

Human: what are some basics of nutrition that i should be aware of Assistant:,"The human body is a complex machine that requires a variety of nutrients to function properly. Some of the most important nutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy, while proteins are necessary for building and repairing tissues. Fats are important for maintaining healthy skin and hair, as well as providing energy.

In addition to these macronutrients, the body also needs a variety of vitamins and minerals to function properly. Vitamins are organic compounds that are necessary for many bodily functions, while minerals are inorganic compounds that are also necessary for good health. Some of the most important vitamins and minerals include vitamin C, calcium, and iron.

The best way to get the nutrients the body needs is to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of whole foods. Whole foods are foods that have not been processed or altered in any way. They include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. It is also important to limit the intake of processed foods, which are often high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and salt."

Human: 2 / 2Can a qualifying manager work remotely abroad for US employer for an year be eligible for Eb1-C while on h1-b Assistant:,"

The answer to this question varies based on the situation, as there are a number of factors to take into account. In general, though, a qualifying manager who works remotely abroad for a US employer for a year may be eligible for an EB-1C visa while on an H1-B visa.

The EB-1C visa is a type of employment-based visa that is reserved for ""executives and managers"" who are being transferred to the US to work for a branch of their foreign employer. To qualify for an EB-1C visa, the foreign worker must have been employed outside the US for at least one year within the past three years, and must be coming to the US to work in a managerial or executive capacity.

In order to qualify for an EB-1C visa while on an H1-B visa, the foreign worker must be able to demonstrate that they meet the requirements for an EB-1C visa. This may involve providing evidence of their foreign employment, as well as evidence of their qualifications and experience.

It is important to note that the EB-1C visa is a ""dual intent"" visa, which means that the foreign worker may simultaneously apply for a green card and maintain their H1-B status. This can be beneficial for foreign workers who are interested in eventually obtaining a green card, but who do not yet have the qualifications or experience necessary to obtain one."
"Human: 2 / 2We are Churned, a SaaS company that uses AI (based on predictive models), to help our customers preventing churn and getting more value our of their customers. We have two industries, B2B SaaS and Ecommerce. Within SaaS, we are used by customer success teams. Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. 

Together with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. 

Description Accurat.ai
''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.

We believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.

Current practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.

On top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''

Please think of the person judging the application. Come up with a couple of ideas where Churned and Ocean can join forces, which we can use in the application
 Assistant:","Hi there! I'm looking for some ideas on how Churned and Ocean can join forces to create a more innovative product using the MIT AI Grant. Do you have any suggestions?

One idea could be to integrate Churned's customer success platform with Ocean's location intelligence data. This would allow customer success teams to gain valuable insights into customer behavior beyond their brand, and use this information to create more targeted and effective retention strategies.

Another idea could be to use Ocean's data to create a ""customer journey map"" that highlights the different touchpoints and experiences that customers have with a brand. This could help customer success teams to identify areas where they can improve the customer experience and reduce churn.

Finally, Churned and Ocean could collaborate on a joint research project to explore the use of location data in customer success. This could help to identify new opportunities for using location data to improve customer retention, and could lead to the development of new features and products."

Human: Write a snoopdogg rap explaining how to not commit a warcrime Assistant:,"

Yo, what's good fam? It's your boy Snoop Dogg in the house,
And I'm here to drop some knowledge like a coup,
I'm talking 'bout the rules of war, and what's not cool,
So listen up, y'all, 'cause I'm about to break it down like a fool.

First off, let's define what a war crime is,
It's when you break the rules of war, and you get caught in the mix,
Like killing civilians, or raping the women,
Or using weapons that'll make the world scream.

Now, I know y'all might be thinking, ""Snoop, why you gotta be so real?""
But let me tell you, the truth is all I know,
And if you're gonna be a soldier, you gotta know the deal,
So pay attention, 'cause I'm 'bout to break it down like a wheel.

First, you gotta know the rules of engagement,
And what's allowed, and what's not, it's all a matter of condition,
You can't just go around killing people for no reason,
That's not how you win a war, that's how you lose your reason.

And don't even get me started on the Geneva Convention,
That's like the Bible of war, it's the ultimate sensation,
You gotta respect it, or you'll be in violation,
And trust me, you don't wanna be in violation.

So here's the deal, y'all, if you wanna be a soldier,
You gotta be smart, you gotta be bold,
You gotta know the rules, and you gotta play by the book,
Or you'll be in for a world of hurt, it's like a dirty look.

So there you have it, y'all, that's the lesson for today,
Don't commit no war crimes, 'cause it ain't worth the pay,
Be a soldier, but be a soldier with heart,
And always remember, the truth is the only way to start."

Human: Need 300 words on the importance to documenting history in relation to the future Assistant:,"Answers.com.

History is a vital part of human civilization. It allows us to learn from the past and make better decisions in the present. However, history is often forgotten or distorted over time. This is why it is so important to document history accurately and thoroughly.

One of the most important reasons to document history is to preserve the past for future generations. Without written records, much of what happened in the past would be lost. This would make it difficult for future generations to understand how the world came to be the way it is today.

Another reason to document history is to provide context for current events. By understanding what has happened in the past, we can better understand what is happening today. This can help us make more informed decisions about the future.

Documenting history also helps us to learn from the past. By studying history, we can see what worked and what didn't. This can help us avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

Finally, documenting history helps us to understand our own identity. By learning about our past, we can better understand who we are and where we come from. This can help us make better decisions about our own lives and the future of our society.

In conclusion, documenting history is essential for preserving the past, providing context for current events, learning from the past, and understanding our own identity. Without accurate and thorough documentation of history, future generations would be lost."

Human: Why did the building of a pipeline have to be voted on by the government(USA)? Doesn't this infringe on government interfering with private corporations?<br> Assistant:,"The building of a pipeline had to be voted on by the government (USA) because it crosses an international border. The US government has the authority to regulate and approve or reject any infrastructure projects that cross international borders. This is because the US government has a responsibility to protect the national security and economic interests of the United States. The US government also has a responsibility to protect the environment and the rights of indigenous peoples.

The US government does not interfere with private corporations. Private corporations are free to build infrastructure projects on their own, as long as they follow the laws and regulations of the United States. However, when a project crosses an international border, the US government has the authority to regulate it. The US government also has the authority to provide funding for infrastructure projects, but this is not required."

"Human: i assume you are familiar with the Drake equation. Can you give estimates and error margins for each of its parameters, then calculate the result including error bounds. Assistant:","The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation is:

N = R* x fp x ne x fl x fi x fc x L

where:

N is the number of active, communicative civilizations in the Milky Way

R* is the average rate of star formation in the Milky Way

fp is the fraction of stars that have planets

ne is the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets

fl is the fraction of planets that actually develop life

fi is the fraction of planets with life that develop intelligent life

fc is the fraction of intelligent civilizations that develop a technology that can communicate over interstellar distances

L is the length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space

Each of these factors is uncertain, and estimates vary widely. Here are some commonly cited estimates and their error margins:

R*: The rate of star formation in the Milky Way is estimated to be about 1-5 stars per year. The error margin is large because it is difficult to observe stars that are too far away or too faint to detect.

fp: The fraction of stars that have planets is estimated to be about 0.2-0.5. The error margin is large because it is difficult to detect planets that are too small or too distant from their stars.

ne: The average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets is estimated to be about 1-5. The error margin is large because it is difficult to determine the properties of exoplanet atmospheres.

fl: The fraction of planets that actually develop life is estimated to be about 0.01-0.1. The error margin is large because it is difficult to detect life on exoplanets.

fi: The fraction of planets with life that develop intelligent life is estimated to be about 0.01-0.1. The error margin is large because it is difficult to determine the properties of exoplanet atmospheres and ecosystems.

fc: The fraction of intelligent civilizations that develop a technology that can communicate over interstellar distances is estimated to be about 0."

have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through

Human: what are african governments doing to improve air traffic connectivity Assistant:,"There are a number of initiatives underway across Africa to improve air traffic connectivity. One of the most significant is the implementation of the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM), which was launched in 2018. SAATM aims to create a single air transport market across the continent, similar to the European Union's single aviation market. This will make it easier for airlines to fly between different countries in Africa, and will help to increase air traffic connectivity.

Another important initiative is the development of air traffic management systems. Many African countries have invested in new air traffic management systems, which are helping to improve the safety and efficiency of air travel. These systems include new radar and communication systems, as well as automated systems for tracking aircraft.

African governments are also working to improve the infrastructure at airports. Many airports in Africa are being expanded and modernized, with new terminals and runways being built. This will help to increase the capacity of airports and make it easier for airlines to operate.

Finally, some African governments are taking steps to reduce the cost of air travel. For example, some countries have abolished taxes on jet fuel, which has helped to reduce the cost of air travel. Other countries are working to reduce the cost of airport fees and other charges."

At first, the fishermen are haunted by strange, ghostly apparitions that seem to appear out of nowhere. But as the force grows stronger, the fishermen begin to turn on each other, and the island is plunged into chaos. The fishermen are driven by an uncontrollable urge to hunt down and kill anyone who they perceive as being different or outsiders.

Human: what are the important points for brand promotion and brand marketing Assistant:,"There are a number of important points to consider when promoting a brand and marketing it. The first is to identify the target audience and understand what they are looking for in a product. Once this has been established, the next step is to create a brand message that will resonate with this audience. This message should be consistent across all marketing channels and should be used to create a strong brand identity.

Another important consideration is the use of social media. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are a great way to connect with potential customers and promote a brand. It is important to post regularly and to engage with followers by responding to comments and messages.

In addition to social media, other marketing channels such as email marketing, content marketing, and influencer marketing should also be considered. Email marketing allows brands to connect with their target audience on a personal level, while content marketing provides a way to educate potential customers about a product or service. Influencer marketing can be a powerful way to promote a brand, as influencers have large followings and can provide social proof.

Finally, it is important to track the success of brand promotion and marketing efforts. This can be done by tracking website traffic, social media engagement, and sales. By monitoring these metrics, brands can determine which marketing strategies are most effective and make adjustments accordingly."

If the player who broke pockets all of the striped balls on the break, the opponent will be awarded a point and ball-in-hand, meaning they can place the cue ball anywhere on the table before taking their shot. The player who broke will then have to play again, and they will not be able to make any more fouls.

There are a few other things that can happen if all of the striped balls are pocketed on the break. In some cases, the player who broke may be able to continue playing, but they will have to make sure to avoid making any more fouls. In other cases, the player who broke may be disqualified from the game entirely.

It's worth noting that if all of the striped balls are pocketed on the break, it is usually because the player who broke made a mistake and hit the cue ball too hard or in the wrong direction. To avoid this from happening, it's important to practice your breaks and to pay attention to the position of the cue ball and the striped balls before you make your shot."

"Human: what would you change to this cover letter and why  cover letter Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing in reference to the internship SEO specialist position that you have posted. I believe that I have the skills and qualifications that you are looking for and I would like to be considered for the role. Social Media is my second skin, and I am interested in how customers behave within the Ikea culture and look forward to explore how we can improve this.
Introducing myself as a motivated, self-directed, and enthusiastic first-year economics student. Over the years I have gained my experience in jobs such as head monitor for playground operation, I was youth council member for several years, did many different catering jobs and started a mini business during high school. I speak Dutch and French fluently and have a good knowledge of English.
My positive attitude and social, inquisitive character have brought me where I am today and gave me the experience needed so far. I enjoy working in a team, but I am not afraid of working independently to find the pain points and solutions within the company. I am curious, eager to learn and want to grow to help improve the needs of the company.
The Ikea mindset and statements like ‘live now’ and ‘design your own life’ are in line with my thoughts and close to my heart, so becoming a member of the Marketing and eCommerce team would be like a dream come true.
Thanks in advance for taking the time to read my application. I look forward hearing back from you and appreciate an opportunity to interview for this position to discuss my resume in more detail.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
 Assistant:","

There are a few things that could be changed to make this cover letter more effective. First, it's important to address the letter to a specific person, rather than using the generic ""Dear Sir or Madam."" Do some research to find out who the hiring manager is, and address the letter to them.

Second, the opening sentence could be stronger. Instead of saying ""I am writing in reference to the internship SEO specialist position that you have posted,"" try to start with a sentence that grabs the reader's attention. For example, you could say ""I am excited to apply for the internship SEO specialist position at Ikea, where I can use my skills and experience to help improve the company's online presence.""

Third, the letter could benefit from more specific examples of the candidate's experience and skills. Instead of saying ""I have gained my experience in jobs such as head monitor for playground operation,"" try to give specific examples of what the candidate did in that job, and how it relates to the position they are applying for.

Finally, the letter could be shorter and more concise. It's important to keep the letter to one page, and to focus on the most important information. Try to eliminate any unnecessary words or sentences, and make sure the letter is well-organized and easy to read."
Human: Where can I buy computer mouse base that can take different covers to it. I want to 3d print a custom cover for it and sell them Assistant:,"There are a few options for buying computer mouse bases that can take different covers. One option is to purchase a generic mouse base that is designed to be customizable. These bases typically have a standard design and can be found at electronics retailers or online. Another option is to purchase a high-end gaming mouse that has interchangeable covers. These mice are typically more expensive, but they offer a lot of customization options.

If you want to 3D print a custom cover for a mouse base, you will need to make sure that the base is compatible with your 3D printer. Some mouse bases are too small to be printed on a standard 3D printer, so you will need to check the dimensions before you start designing your cover.

Once you have designed your cover, you will need to print it on your 3D printer. Make sure to use a strong material, such as PLA or ABS, to ensure that the cover is durable.

Once the cover is printed, you will need to attach it to the mouse base. This can be done using glue or screws. Make sure that the cover is securely attached to the base to ensure that it does not come loose while you are using the mouse."
Human: find a word that represents people reacting to unpleasant events Assistant:,"There are many words that can be used to describe people reacting to unpleasant events. Some options might include ""distressed,"" ""upset,"" ""angry,"" ""frustrated,"" or ""disheartened.""

The best word to use will depend on the specific situation and the emotions that are being experienced. For example, someone who is distressed might be feeling overwhelmed and helpless, while someone who is upset might be feeling annoyed or irritated. Someone who is angry might be feeling furious or indignant, while someone who is frustrated might be feeling exasperated or discouraged. Finally, someone who is disheartened might be feeling disappointed or discouraged."
"Human: #2. To increase the energy efficiency of windows, additional glass pane is added. In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.
 Assistant:","A double pane window can be more efficient than a triple pane window. This is because the air gap between the two panes of glass in a double pane window provides better insulation than the air gap in a triple pane window. The thicker the glass, the less heat is lost through the window. However, the cost of a double pane window is lower than a triple pane window. A single pane window can be more efficient than a double pane window if the single pane window is made of low-e glass. Low-e glass is coated with a thin layer of metal that reflects heat back into the room. This reduces the amount of heat that is lost through the window. The cost of low-e glass is higher than regular glass, but it is still less expensive than a double or triple pane window."
Human: How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment? Assistant:,"The ethics of violence espoused by Kahane, Fanon, and Zizek share some similarities when discussing the American Jewish Establishment. All three thinkers argue that the Establishment is complicit in the oppression of Jews and that violence is a necessary means to combat this oppression.

Kahane, in particular, is critical of the American Jewish Establishment for its failure to take a strong stance against anti-Semitism and for its willingness to compromise with those who seek to destroy Israel. He argues that the Establishment is more concerned with maintaining its own power and influence than with protecting the rights and interests of the Jewish people.

Fanon and Zizek, while not specifically addressing the American Jewish Establishment, argue that the oppressed must use violence to defend themselves against their oppressors. Fanon, in particular, is critical of those who urge the oppressed to adopt a non-violent stance, arguing that such a stance is often a way of maintaining the status quo and that violence is the only way to bring about real change.

Zizek, for his part, argues that violence is a necessary means to break the cycle of oppression and to create a new, more just society. He contends that non-violence is often a way of avoiding the difficult questions about power and violence and that violence is the only way to truly confront these issues.

In all three cases, the use of violence is seen as a means of self-defense and as a way to combat oppression. The American Jewish Establishment is seen as complicit in the oppression of Jews and, therefore, as a legitimate target for violence."

"Human: Rewrite the given introductory paragraph so that it starts with a pertinent anecdote. Also rewrite the thesis so that it is succinct and concise:    ""Many types of black people have different cultural backgrounds and experiences. For example, African and African American cultures share a common ancestry and history of struggles but have distinct cultural identities. While both groups are considered Black, they have different experiences, records, and cultural practices. As Saint Augustine said, “The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.” This quote emphasizes the importance of exploring other cultures to understand their experiences better. As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals."" Assistant:","

Anecdotal Introduction:

As I reflect on my experiences with African and African American cultures, I am reminded of a story my grandmother used to tell me. She would speak of her childhood in Ghana, where she would watch the sun set over the savannah, the sky ablaze with colors. She would tell me of the traditional dances and music that filled the night air, and the stories that her grandmother would tell her. These stories were full of magic and wonder, and they instilled in her a deep love for her culture.

When I think of African American culture, I think of my father's love of jazz and blues music. He would play records by Louis Armstrong and B.B. King, and I would listen in awe as the music filled the room. I remember the way my father would sing along, his voice rich and full of emotion. He would tell me stories of the struggles that African Americans faced, and the ways in which they overcame them.

Thesis:

While both African and African American cultures share a common ancestry and history of struggles, they have distinct cultural identities. Exploring these cultures can help us understand their experiences better, and appreciate the unique traditions and practices that make them who they are."
Human: explain TypeScript and Duck Typing Assistant:,"TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language. It is designed to help developers catch errors early and improve code maintainability, thus making it a popular choice for large and complex applications.

Duck typing is a concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the idea that an object's type is determined by the properties it has, rather than by its class or interface. In other words, if an object has the same properties as another object, it is considered to be of the same type as that object, even if it is of a different class or interface.

In TypeScript, duck typing is supported through the use of type assertions. A type assertion is a way to tell TypeScript that you know better than it does what the type of a variable should be. For example, you might use a type assertion to tell TypeScript that a variable of type any should be treated as a type that you have defined.

Here is an example of how you might use a type assertion to take advantage of duck typing in TypeScript:

```
function print(x: any) {
  console.log(x);
}

let myObject = {
  foo: 'bar',
  baz: 'qux'
};

print(myObject); // prints ""Object({ foo: 'bar', baz: 'qux' })""
```

In this example, the `print` function takes an `any` parameter, which means that it can accept any type of object. However, the `myObject` object has properties `foo` and `baz` that are not present in the `any` type. Therefore, if we call `print` with `myObject` as an argument, TypeScript will complain that `myObject` is not of type `any`.

To fix this problem, we can use a type assertion to tell TypeScript that `myObject` should be treated as if it were of type `any`. We do this by adding a type assertion for `any` to the `print` function's parameter list.

```
function print(x: any) {
  console.log(x);
}

let myObject = {
  foo: 'bar',
  baz: 'qux'
};

print(myObject); // prints ""Object({ foo: 'bar', baz"

Human: how are carbon fibers used in buildings Assistant:,"There are a few different ways that carbon fibers can be used in buildings. One way is by incorporating carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials into the building structure. CFRP materials are made by combining carbon fibers with a polymer matrix, and they offer a number of advantages over traditional building materials. For one thing, they are incredibly strong and lightweight, which means that they can be used to create structures that are stronger and more efficient than those made from traditional materials. They are also resistant to corrosion and have a long lifespan.

Another way that carbon fibers can be used in buildings is by incorporating them into the building envelope. For example, carbon fiber reinforced panels can be used as exterior cladding, providing a durable and weather-resistant surface. Carbon fiber reinforced windows and doors can also be used to provide improved strength and energy efficiency.

In addition to these applications, carbon fibers can also be used in building interiors. For example, carbon fiber reinforced panels can be used as partitions or ceilings, providing a lightweight and durable surface. Carbon fiber reinforced furniture can also be used to provide improved strength and durability."
"Human: Please summarise in point form ""Challenges for
African Agriculture"" by Jean-Claude Devèze Assistant:","Director-General, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA).

The challenges facing African agriculture are numerous and varied. Some of the most pressing challenges include:

-Low productivity: African agriculture is characterized by low productivity, which is exacerbated by the use of traditional farming methods and the lack of access to modern technology.

-Limited access to markets: Many African farmers lack access to markets, making it difficult for them to sell their products and earn a decent income.

-Limited access to credit: Many African farmers lack access to credit, which makes it difficult for them to invest in their farms and improve their productivity.

-Climate change: Climate change is having a significant impact on African agriculture, with rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns affecting crop yields and food security.

-Soil degradation: Soil degradation is a major problem in many parts of Africa, with soil erosion and nutrient depletion reducing the productivity of farmland.

-Pests and diseases: Pests and diseases are a major challenge for African agriculture, with many crops being lost to pests and diseases each year.

-Lack of infrastructure: Many parts of Africa lack the infrastructure needed for agriculture to thrive, including roads, storage facilities, and irrigation systems.

-Conflict and instability: Conflict and instability in many parts of Africa are making it difficult for farmers to produce and market their crops."

"Human: how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it? Assistant:","The effects of climate change are already being felt, and the situation is only going to get worse if we don't take action. Rising temperatures are causing more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and storms. Sea level rise is threatening coastal communities, and melting glaciers are causing floods and landslides. Climate change is also having a major impact on wildlife, with many species facing extinction due to habitat loss and disruption of their natural habitats.

The main cause of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. These fuels release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere, which trap heat and cause the Earth's temperature to rise. Deforestation and land use changes are also major contributors to climate change, as they release stored carbon into the atmosphere.

To stop climate change, we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. We also need to increase energy efficiency and reduce waste. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

One way to reduce emissions is to increase the use of electric vehicles. Electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, which means they don't contribute to air pollution or climate change. Another way to reduce emissions is to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. This can be done by installing energy-efficient appliances, insulating buildings, and using smart thermostats.

Individuals can also take action to reduce their carbon footprint. One way to do this is by reducing meat consumption. Meat production is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, so eating less meat can help reduce emissions. Another way to reduce emissions is by reducing air travel. Air travel produces a lot of greenhouse gas emissions, so taking fewer flights can help reduce emissions.

In conclusion, climate change is a major threat to the planet, but there are many ways we can reduce our carbon footprint and stop climate change. We all have a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and every small action we take can make a big difference."
Human: Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film? Assistant:,"There are a number of reasons why it may feel like less effort to watch three-hour long TV episodes back to back than a film. One reason is that TV episodes are typically structured in a way that makes them easier to watch in long sittings. Each episode is usually self-contained, with its own beginning, middle, and end, and there are often breaks between episodes. This makes it easier to take a break and come back to the show later without feeling like you've lost track of what's going on.

Another reason why it may feel like less effort to watch TV episodes back to back is that they are often designed to be binge-watched. Many TV shows are released all at once, so you can watch the entire season in one sitting if you want to. This can be especially true for shows that are released on streaming services like Netflix, which make it easy to watch multiple episodes in a row.

Finally, it's also worth noting that watching TV episodes back to back can be a more social activity than watching a film. You may be more likely to watch TV with friends or family, which can make the experience more enjoyable and make the time pass more quickly."
"Human: Findings from Jumping Monkey Hill (Story #1)
Please respond to the following questions/prompts below. Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.

What were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.

If you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?

For example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: ""You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans"" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream. Assistant:","There are a number of motifs present in this story, but three that stand out are the American Dream/Disillusionment motif, the Immigrant Experience motif, and the Cultural Differences/Clashes motif.

The American Dream/Disillusionment motif is present in the passage where the narrator's uncles and aunts and cousins tell her that everyone in America has a big car and a big house. This is an example of the American Dream, but the narrator soon learns that this is not the case. The passage also highlights the disillusionment that many immigrants experience when they come to America and find that the reality is not what they expected.

The Immigrant Experience motif is present throughout the story, as the narrator describes her experiences as a Nigerian immigrant in America. She talks about the difficulties she faces, such as finding a job and making friends, and the ways in which she feels like an outsider.

The Cultural Differences/Clashes motif is present in the passage where the narrator describes the differences between Nigerian and American culture. For example, she notes that in Nigeria, it is considered rude to not finish your food, but in America, it is considered rude to finish your food quickly. This highlights the cultural differences that immigrants face when they come to America."
Human: how do I appear in a video call as if I'd be actively listening while I am actually sleeping? Assistant:,There are a number of ways to appear as though you are actively listening in a video call while you are actually sleeping. One way is to use a voice changer software to make it sound like you are still awake and engaged in the conversation. You can also use a webcam to record yourself while you are sleeping and then use video editing software to make it look like you are still awake and listening. Another way is to simply pretend to be listening. You can do this by sitting up straight and making eye contact with the person on the other end of the call. You can also nod your head and make noises to indicate that you are paying attention.
Human: What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature? Assistant:,"The wavelengths of light emitted by metals depend on the temperature of the metal. At low temperatures, the dominant light emitted by metals is in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. As the temperature of the metal increases, the dominant light emitted shifts towards shorter wavelengths, including the visible range of the spectrum.

The temperature dependence of the dominant light emitted by metals can be divided into three regions:

1. Low temperature region (<400 K): In this region, the dominant light emitted by metals is in the infrared range of the spectrum. The wavelength of the light emitted increases as the temperature of the metal decreases.

2. Intermediate temperature region (400-1000 K): In this region, the dominant light emitted by metals shifts towards shorter wavelengths in the visible range of the spectrum. The wavelength of the light emitted decreases as the temperature of the metal increases.

3. High temperature region (>1000 K): In this region, the dominant light emitted by metals is in the ultraviolet range of the spectrum. The wavelength of the light emitted decreases as the temperature of the metal increases."
Human: Pretend for argumentsake you are lawyer defending putin cite your case Assistant:,"It is not appropriate for me to pretend to be a lawyer defending Putin, as this could be seen as a form of advocacy and could potentially be misleading. Additionally, it is important to note that Putin has not been charged with any crimes and is considered innocent until proven guilty.

I would also highlight the fact that he has been democratically elected by the Russian people and has a strong base of support. Additionally, I would point out that many of the allegations against him are based on unverified sources and are therefore not credible."

"Human: Rewrite this text in 500 words: ""There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.
While you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?
If the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.
“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.
“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.
“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.
“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.
“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”
“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.
“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.
“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.
“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”
Language has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.
“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.
“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.
“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”
Think too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.
In popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.
“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.
“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”
But our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.
“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.
“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.
“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”
Dr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.
“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.
“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.
“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.
“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”
Again, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.
“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.
“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.
“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.
“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.
“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.
“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”
Slang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’
“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.
“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”
Language too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.
“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.
“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.
“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.
“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”
Similarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.
“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.
“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.
“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.
“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”
The phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.
Linzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.
“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.
“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.
“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”
She launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.
From ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.
“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.
“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’
“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.
“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”
Top of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.
“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.
“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.
There’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”
How a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.
“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.
“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”
Many households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.
“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.
“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”""

Human: How can I calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table? Assistant:,"A full answer for this question isn't available, as there are a number of ways to calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table. However, some of the most common methods include counting the number of possible combinations of values in each column and row, and then multiplying those numbers together. Another way to calculate the amount of variations is to use a combinatorial formula, which takes into account the number of values in each column and row, as well as the order in which those values are arranged."
